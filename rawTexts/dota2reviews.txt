Then it taught me to hate them all.
good game
It's like roulette; fun until it turns into Russian.
God bless anyone that dares to enter in this cesspool of toxicity

In Dota 2,

Not many people speak your language.
Not many people play well.
Not many people talk nicely.
Not many people work as a team.

But if you find people that do...
You'll have the most fun you've ever had.
If you are worried your children are doing drugs, show them this game. They will be too busy fulfilling their innermost masochistic desires while hopelessly right clicking that they will not have the time for drugs or friends or anything else really.
"THE PUB SUPPORT"


"Where are wards?" The pub Carry demanded.

"I placed them and they were countered" the Support began, "I am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm, protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more, also possibly sentries to remove their-"

"UP COUR PLS" the mid hero politely added.

"Give Savle" The Carry demanded. "Certainly." replies the support, using the salve on the Carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave.

"So where is mek?" the Carry said, after he was ganked due to overextending. The Support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse.

"Again, having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards, I don't think a 7 minute Mek is viable." The Support replies.
"Haha look your level, so low, noob" the Carry retorted. "U have no item xaxa".

"Well, jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which I attempted to give you, the carry, the priority over."

The Carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower, oblivious to the enemy tp that the Support moved away from.
"Report Support, usless" The carry cried in allchat, in between mentioning various aspects of the Support's Mother's anatomy.

"Instead of reporting and acting like that, why don't you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry?" the Support asked, as he watched the Carry return to afk-lasthitting lane creeps.

"HAH, support is for noskill noobs like you!"
Great Russian language simulator.
So many diffrent heroes and diffrent builds that you can do compared to all the other Moba's in the market. If your looking for a moba to really stick your teeth into and learn lots this is it. 9/10

COMING SOON TO A COMPUTER NEAR YOU
Comrades, it is time to rejoice. The cult classic Communist adventure saga continues with the newest installment of the series, Downfall of the Americans 2: Stalin's Revemge. Featuring the original cast of Stalin and all of his closest friends, including Russian Bear, Dr. Vodka, and Krokodealer, this game is a must have for the whole village. Destroy filthy American Strongholds to spread wealth to all of your comrades, use teamwork to crush the American scum, and lead your comrades to victory. Feel as though you are on a whole different level than your peers? Play ranked matches to realize that you suck just as much as they do. Looking for an easy game to boost morale? Enter a bot match to fight Americans as they should be percieved: easy to find and easy to kill. The game even features collectable hats to help your characters survive the harsh winter. Karl Marx/10
This game allows you to exert your knowledge and understanding of layered mechanics (and exceptions of those game mechanisms) onto randomly-selected regional people without their permission or interest.

Heated debates can lead to forged alliances to achieve that common goal or end into displaced frustration projected onto others to substitute one's own failures and inabilities to execute one's characters' (heroes') qualities.

On the other hand, this game allows one to create 'hero build' guides as a pretense to be productive with his/her vexation as well as to fruitlessly raise the standard of expected knowledge of the game through item and ability walkthroughs in hopes that those one encounters in the future, rely on these indirect, serviced suggestion(s).
Imagine you're playing a game with a few friends and you're having fun. You exchange jokes and high fives all around after every epic moment. Your bro turns to you and says, "I love this game, and I definitely do not want to kill myself!" You all laugh. You are having a good time. You are not playing Dota 2.
Dota 2, where do I start. This game has ruined my social life, I spend every day on this game, training, waiting, and drinking through my mountain dew, to one day become the greatest.

My father said to me, "Son, you will never be dondo."

I said to my father, "Dad, I mid, or I feed."

My dad dropped to the ground in tears, screaming at the all mighty gabe newell, begging for his son back, but it was too late, I was already back on dota, at mid, blaming my team for sucking

This game is why I wake up, Why I masturbate, why I decide that masturbating while playing is a good idea. Thank you for such an amazing game, without this game I would have nothing to get mad at when I am rock solid.
This is yet another new release by the company "MOBA" (you may know this company from their popular games such as League of Legends, Dead island Epidemic and Dawngate).
This is a very slow paced first person shooter set in the age after the 3rd great war in which humanity has been set back in the ages where magic was still okay to use, in this game you play as an ex soldier trying to defeat the main communist overlord "sniper" who threatens america as we know it.

The single player aspect of this game is probably the best experience you'll have in this game as the online is currently dead, the developers stopped updating this game after league of legends was confirmed to be more balanced and a hell of a lot better.

They did however unlock a new game mode called "Compendium" in which you simulate reading a book and collect trading cards.

I'll give this game 3 meepos out of 5, it's okay but the fact that you're required to be able to speak russian to get this game really lets it down.
Hours of fun, all you have to do is select in which Russia you want to play today!
1,000 hours played: "OMG you have 1,000 hours played go outside and get a life you virgin"
100 hours played: "OMG you only have 100 hrs played you idiot noob delete Dota"

10/10 Dota community logic
I've punched more holes in my wall then you could imagine playing this game. 11/10 recommend.
11/10 game (including updates)
1/10 community (including myself)
Quit playing. Try to be a better person.
Before playing this game I thought Brazillians were only bad at soccer.
When I was young, I started to suffer from a major crack addiction. This was becoming a real problem. after telling a friend about my struggle with narcotics, he suggested I played this crazy game called DOTA 2. I spent some of my crack money on a new computer so I could play this game. The more I played, the more it started to attract me. In the end, I realised that this game was a much healthier substitute to crack cocaine. I gave up crack last year, never looked back. Now I waste my life away playing DOTA 2 instead.

10/10 Saved my life
In this game you can:
1- Murderer trees
2- Kill a ancient creature chilling in his cave without mercy and and steal his cheese
3- Learn at most 9 different languages in every single match
4- Kill others players for no apparent reason
5- Can develop erectile dysfunction due to extended seated hours

It's basically the best thing ever. 10/10
I only play Dota when I feel like killing myself
This game has made me racist towards those who speak any language other than english. Would buy again.
I Became calm person in real life because of this game
Dota 2 is sequel to critically acclaimed hat trading sim, Team Fortress 2.
What Valve has managed to do with hats is astounding. They've improved upon everything that the original had to offer, and then they kicked it up a notch.

Imagine a world where everyone and every thing has a hat. Now imagine that you can become THAT hat. You are the weapon, you are the bullet, you are the sword edge.
That's immersion on a new level. Never before has an experience been this good.

I recommend this to anyone who has ever, or will ever dream of hat, hats, or hat accesories.
If you haven't yet, you need to experience this.
Go do it. Now.
11/10 Hats, it's all right.

2016 Update: I haven't touched this game in 2+ years and there's a reason for that; I'm too busy wearing and showing off my hats. Great hats/10
I've tried Rosetta Stone, duolingo, and even college classes, but nothing has taught me Russian or Brazilian better than this! And it's free!
9/10
i am still waiting for the tenth player confirm
One day, a wise man intoduce me into this game. "it shall protect your virginity, my lad" he said.
It's like crack. When it's good it's good, and when it's bad it's still pretty good.
I can be a tree. Highly recommend.
When I started playing Dota 2, I didn't know any Russian, now I'm Vladimir Putin. A better language learning software than Rosetta Stone.

69/10, would recommend.
best way to learn russian.
Most fun way to commit social suicide and learn Russian.

10/10.
DotA 2 Will drain you of your will to keep playing, and yet you will always return.
DotA 2 Will make you regret ever playing it, and yet you will always think "Just one more game"
DotA 2 Will take away all your free time, and yet you'll almost feel proud of how many hours you have in DotA 2.

With the time you spend on this game, you could do all sorts. Study on learning a new set of skills to further your career. You could raise money for charity. You could be an aid worker for a foreign country and help improve the lives of others. You could even just play other games, you know, those ones sitting in your backlog, pushed aside by DotA 2.

But you won't.
You will always return to this game. The maximum you will learn from playing this game is how to insult others in various languages (mostly these languages will consist of Russian and Peruvian.). This game will become as much a part of your life as eating or blinking. Half the time you will not even remember having played DotA 2 on a certain day. It just becomes natural to you.

If you start playing this game, you become addicted.
You will also spend obscene amounts of money on cosmetics. A quick chest purchase here, a few random items on the market there, and boom. Like me you'll have spent far too much on a game which needs no money spent on it. If you start DotA 2, not only will you be subjecting yourself to a motivation-destroying hobby, but also subjecting yourself to a wallet emptying one too.


tl;dr This game will take away your time, money and patience for others. You will become an angry person.

Basically 10/10 GOTY All years
This game sucks, you can't even jump.

Just like real-time chess, but everyone is a queen. Some queens shoot lasers, some summon huge Golems and some sing so hard your eardrums burst. Dota 2 is definitely one of the best games of this generation, and I'm certain it will remain as popular and as influnencal for many years to come.

Graphics: 8.5/10
Very pretty, the art direction in DotA 2 is one of the best. The source engine ensures you can run it on anything more powerful than a toaster, and have it look great too. Cosmetics look great, and fit perfectly, with some exceptions,(I'm looking at you Alpine Ursa) but many stay true to the heros artstyle.

Sound: 9.5/10
All heros have a multitude of voice lines,and some even respond to one another (e.g Tidehunters hatred for Kunnka). If you find the default anouncer not too flash, theres a huge variety of optional packs, from the smoth talking Narrator from bastion, to the harsh condescending tone of Pyrion Flax.

Gameplay: 10/10
The big one. Theres a reason DotA Allstars got so popular, not just from the incredible passsion from the community, or the dedication of IceFrog and co., but from the incredible gameplay that spawned one of gamings most popular genres. From perfectly co-ordinating a fountain hook, to getting stuck on top of a cliff accidentally as Storm Spirit, no other genre rivals DotA 2 outstanding strategic gameplay and near-vertical learning curve. At the time of writing, I have 7,469 hours played and I've only just scratched the surface in the combos, stratagy and 107 availble heros to use, it takes year of hard work, dedication and passion to become truly great at the strategical masterpeice that is Dota 2.

- beardATTACK @ fren
Thank goodness I wasn't a virgin before I started playing this otherwise I still would be.
Best rts original DotA strategy game ever
mid or meepo
If you're masochistic and enjoy listening to people cuss you out in Portuguese, Spanish, and Russian, you should play. Make sure to set your server settings to US West, US East, and preferred language to English to get the best Portuguese/Spanish/Russian experience.
DOTA 2 is the best in the MOBA class. I've played LoL, DOTA and some lesser known MOBAs and DOTA 2 is by far the best. In addition, it is F2P which is amazing. Unlike LoL or HoN which require you to use a rotating hero list until you buy your own with real money or accumulate enough in-game currency to buy a single hero, DOTA 2 immediately gives you access to its entire library of heroes, for free. The only paid content are cosmetical items that do not change gameplay. Graphics are great. Gameplay is great. Crashes are very minimal. ITS FREE.
As a guy that started playing DotA1 back in 2006, take my words that you'll only be trully able to enjoy this game if you totally dedicate yourself to learn and get better at it in other words, you'll need a lot of TIME to actually enjoy the game.

DOTA2 is a very competitive game, where teamwork is everything, and unfortunately a lot of players don't actually care or know about that, and thus making the game a rather difficult experience, especially for new players.

New player advice: Read as much as you can on the internet about DOTA2,watch videos, watch tournaments, get as much help as you can.Starting fresh new in a game that has an audience this big with a lot of experienced players is tough, since the majority of the players that will be on your team will expect you to know the game.
As a new player you would expect the game to put in a team with other new players, right?
Well DOTA2 system doesn't work like that, even if you're a new player, there's still a chance that you'll get in a team with someone who has 2000hours in the game, this games evaluates you in WINrate, and any new account has a rather high Win rate, so it ends up putting you with very experienced players even if they are considered "bad", you most likely won't get in a bracket with ONLY new players.

As for playing the game, I would advise you to NEVER play SOLO ranked before actually knowing a huge part of the game, you can play NORMAL matchmaking or even PARTY with your friends, but never actually try to get a SOLO rank, without knowing the game you'll most likely get a very low rank and it's really, really hard to climb from there, so don't make this mistake.

Keep in mind this game has a huge community and with that there's a big part of it that consist in toxic players, so it's very common for players in game to start a flame-war and ruin the experience, the best thing to do is open scoreboard and mute those people, this game needs you to be focused on the actual game rather than the people in the chat arguing with each other, even if it means muting all 4 of your teammates, I always say this to my friends "just mute him/them" but they never listen and ends up getting frustrated with the raging guy, don't let those kind of people ruin your game.

Best advice for me is, try to be as POLITE as possible, even if you're playing bad, try to get ideas/advices in-game from your teammates like "What Item should I get for my hero?", saying "My bad" or "Sorry" everytime you do something wrong is also good, it makes people understand that you know you did something wrong and they might start helping you in-game.
Dota 2 is like a black hole. It sucks in your time, energy and chance of getting laid.

But it's fun to spin around in.
I never thought I would spend so much lifetime in a game that makes me want to kill myself every time I play it.










Please, send help.
I learned to hate people I've never met.
Ruined my life, and made me fail school.

11/10
Play at your own risk.
- almost died from heart attacks.
- a friend tried to kill me in real life.
- i lost my job.
- my girlfriend left me.
- spent too much money on hats, now i'm bankcrupt.
- gain too much weight from playing and eating junk food

10/10 would waste my life again
If you're looking for a League of Legends clone, look elsewhere; if you're looking for a MOBA that you can play for a couple weeks or even months and become good at, look elsewhere. I've been playing Dota 2 for around 10 years since it was DotA, the Warcraft III custom map and I'll tell you right now there's still a lot of room for personal improvement. This game boils down to far more than individual skill, tactics, and teamwork/cooperation. The author of "Three Lane Highway" (see pcgamer.com) has called Dota an "isometric wizard-em up" game, and I think it's fitting. There are so many aspects to this game, so many factors that control the outcome that if you try and sit down and list them all it'll take you a couple hours. And you'll still miss some. I have played pretty much every single "Multi-player Online Battle Arena" on the market, and no matter how interesting they are or what different elements they try to bring to the gameplay, I always end up coming back to Dota.

If you want to seriously challenge yourself, and you have the will and motivation to work towards a lofty goal that many are unable to reach, this is the game for you.
Great game. 5k+ Hours. Hard to learn. Impossible to truly master. So many possibilities and variables. Teamwork crucial. Time consuming (games can be 40-70 mins long). Watch is great too. Personally Am trying my best to play a lot less because of life responsibilities. Suggest watching rather than playing if you are time poor. Some players can be toxic (ie. Rude or angry). Suggest muting them for an enjoyable experience
Made me learn russian to better communicate with my fellow russian comrades.

> Well Played!

This game protects my real life virginity.
The Real Dota 2

Dota is a competitive game of action and strategy, played both professionally and casually incompetently by millions of enslaved passionate fans Russians worldwide. Players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes carries, forming two teams of five players five feeders. Radiant heroes then battle their Dire counterparts to control a gorgeous fantasy landscape, waging campaigns of cunning, stealth, and outright warfare raging in an unknown language and teamfighting with one RAMPAGE victor.

Irresistibly colorful on the surface addictive, Dota is a game of infinite depth and complexity which requires, no, infact takes an infinite amount of your life away. Every hero has an array of skills and abilities that combine with the skills of their allies in unexpected ways, to ensure that no game is ever remotely alike that allow players to screw with their allies and get their teams killed. This is one of the reasons that the Dota phenomenon has continued to grow Dota will have more rage quitting and all chat abuse than any other game. Originating as a fan-made Warcraft 3 modification, Dota was an instant underground hit. After coming to Valve, the original community developers have bridged the gap to a more inclusive audience Russia, so that the rest of the world can experience the same core gameplay, but with the level of polish that only Valve can provide learn from these ingenious people and become inspired to spread their knowledge with the rest of the world.

Get a taste of the game that <- Link

NOTE: Original description by Valve, edited by myself.
This game is such a ripoff of Mario Party 8.
When in a game, if someone type this words :
putang ina, bobo, ako mid. Leave the match, don't ever ask why, just do it.
This is an important message for everyone, leave the match.
When Bloodseeker gets above a certain move speed he should make Race Car noises.
Game of the Year, All Years.
First twenty hours playing this game, got called NOOB for so many times that i went down to my basement and cried daily
Second twenty hours playing this game, joined others and called the new guy 'NOOB' to avoid being called 'NOOB'
Third twenty hours playing this, I finally got the courage to call others 'NOOB' all by myself
Fourth twenty hours playing this game, I finally became mature enough to stop with all the NOOB bs and started to give advice to the other players from atop my mighty throne

Overall, DOTA 2 is an addictive, competitive MMO whose community precedes its reputation, almost everyone is downright selfish, everyone only wants more kills to sate their hunger for commendations, which they even beg for.
The trick to enjoying it though ?
start playing with friends or people you know, make a plan, help your teammates, and CHOOSE A SUPPORT IF YOU SEE THERE ARE NONE !
and reach level 13 and you can play ranked matches, where the people are not much friendlier but will at least help you out.
EDIT: oh and always remember to uncheck 'Russia' when selecting servers
why ? no reason, just thought i should say that ^^

GODLIKE GAME ! someone kill it (you will get this reference after playing the game)

Still good in 2016
still cant figure out how to jump
Causes sleep deprivation and total mental breakdown.
10/10.
Part of my life. 10/10.
Dota 2, where teamwork is laughable and everyone is Russian. 10/10
The best program for learning the Russian language.


2k17 edit
PS. 7.00 sucks.
9/10. Would wait for another player again.
I only played a little but it was fun.
Dota 2 is like an abusive relationship. It's not good for you, but you go back to it anyways because it's addicting. You'll lose a game, feel bad, play again, then if you win you'll feel just content. If you lose again, you'll play again. Repeat. There are good moments, there are bad moments, but most of all there are non-english speakers in english servers. Fortunately if you're looking to learn foreign swear words, this is definitely the game for you.

10/10 would cry again.
I used to play LoL, and sunk more money into that game than I care to admit. The great thing about DotA, is EVERY hero is unlocked from the start. LoL has a limited selection of free champions every week, which is fine, but your options are limited during drafting. I found myself buying champs that were popular in the current meta just to compete.

I haven't played LoL in months since getting into DotA, how can I? This game is so much more complex (which is daunting at first), but the more you learn and play the better it gets. Every day I learn something new, I try a new hero or two, and it's awesome.

Highly recommend checking out http://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2 as well as http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dota_2_Wiki .

is a great map.

I may have spent more time watching gameplay vids/strats and tournaments than actually playing the game! The in game spectating client is very well done, it even has casters!

LoL is just... lol! It doesn't compare...
This game ruined my life

I recommend everyone to play Dota 2 and not LoL nor HoN.
Don't get me wrong, I am not hating or anything. I was from HoN for like 2-3 years before Dota 2 was released and tried LoL and actually enjoyed it for a bit but then went back to HoN.

Dota 2 is a great game, an awesome game. I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say. Mechanics are well designed, what makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. This is a team game people, so team work is a must (unless you are solo queuing, then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around). Monster gamers are real.

Dota 2 has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday, and that..

This game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds. A mere game that brings people together, not just friends but complete strangers too. Dota 2 is a game that will never be forgotten.

All in all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better.

P.S. Calm down, it's just a game..
Its the best.. if you have too much friends, and you whant to loose some.
ruined my life. 10/10
I don't know how many times I have uninstalled this game.
Hello am 48 year man from somalia. Sorry for my bad englando. I selled my wife for internet connection for play "dota 2" and i want to become the goodest player like DONDI I play with 400 ping on brazil server and i am challenger 2. pls no copy pasterino, this is mi story.
Insalled game,
Opened game,
Found Match,
"was told to pick an ""easy"" hero like sniper or wraith"
picked sniper,
was told to uninstall,
told them to f-off,
won game,
reported salty nobs(there are plenty)

fell in lovewith the game, now have no life and cry myself to sleep at night.

awsome more than a game.
After being a part of dota 2 community since 2012 when it was not as toxic as it is now i am really sad to give this game a bad review.

Not because of gameplay or Community.

But for the automated report system this game has which is broken and is abused by kids on the regular.

Community as toxic as it is which gives no regards to u but themselves should not be given the priviledge to report someone over false acusations not when the system is automated and the reports that they make are just taken in count never reviewed.

This creates a lot of possibilities as people can report u for playing good and o' believe me they will.

Today it has come to this point where people are being reported for not sucking in game and are sent to low priority no matter what the cause as cause doesnt really matter when its not looked into.

As a dota 2 fanatic i would say this game is a masterpiece even with the community as toxic as it is if u know how to handle it.

But if that community is given the power to shove random people into low priority for no real reason i think its high time i leave steam as a whole because they dont understand how the gaming world works and their support are monkeys on the keyboard .

As i think Valves new Employees are a bunch of kids as well.
how many russians can fit into a single game is the real question here

For those of you who aren't familiar with the MOBA genre, here's a quick explanation. There are two bases, each on opposing corners of the map, and one for each team. The objective is to destroy the opposing team's base. Three roads, or lanes, connect the bases. Low-level units automatically and periodically spawn from each base in groups, and these soldiers travel down the three paths between the bases. As a result, there is always a battle going on in the trio of lanes.
In addition, each team has three defensive towers in each lane on their side of the map, totaling nine towers per team. These structures deliver powerful attacks against enemy soldiers and players, but they can be destroyed through significant effort. Because of this, fights tend to center on the towers.

All of this happens automatically. Unlike in typical RTS games, you don't have to collect resources, build structures, or train units. You only control your hero, which can level up and acquire a range of upgradeable powers. However, its role might best be described as support for the A.I. soldier units. Players help control the battlefronts and destroy enemy towers in the lanes. The idea is to to open your opponent's base up to a direct attack by the A.I. and hero once the towers in a lane are gone. There are five players per team, which of course doesn't divide into the three lanes equally. When a player dies, he respawns at the team's base after a penalty period.








----------------------------------------Pro&Con---------------------------------------------
PROS

1, All At Your Fingertips � players have access to ALL of the game's heroes from the start. No need to unlock or purchase heroes. ( poor LOL)
2, Snowball Easily � dying results in a loss of gold, can magnify the effects of snowballing(Buyback system can make sure you don't lose a game with just one mistake).
3, Huge Variety of Cosmetics and Skins � players can customize individual parts of their heroes from both valve and community. (weapons, armor, helmets, etc.).
4, Custom Game Support � players can build their own custom games within Dota 2 (Pudge Wars, Tower defenses, Racing, Battleships, and more!)
5, Skill-Based and Competitive � similar to LoL, Dota 2 is heavily reliant on a player's skill, is very competitive, and has a large e-Sports scene.


CONS:

1 , Dota directly affects on your life (social life)
2 , Time consuming( Avg about 45 min per game + additional queuing time(about 3-10 mins depends on your region))
3 , Hard for newbies ( up to 500 hrs bot practices at least ---usually about 800 hrs)
4 , hbp due to rage (you may having 3 r e t a r d s and peru feeder/feeders on your side of team)


---------------------------------------ADDITIONS---------------------------------------------

Don't spend too much money on treasures. All the rare items can be purchased through community market if you feel like you are not gonna get any of rare sets.
The reason I hate russia now.

10/10
When Putin invades the Ukraine and World War 3 starts, this game will be the reason why so many people from all around the world will gladly pick up arms against the Russians.
Hi. I only recommend you this game if you love MOBAs, but I didn't like MOBAs and now I have 1200 hours in it. I was a COD player, an MW2 player. Of course you will not be ''pro'' in your first matches. To be good you need a lot of training. If you played LoL and you have 30 lvl its sure you know the "basics". In this game the most important thing is the "Last Hitting" at the start, because if you have more gold and XP than your enemy, you own the game. The game may be boring, but if you have friends it won't be. I think the boring part is the first 13 lvl because you can't play some gamemodes before that. If you are new here you need to complete the training! If you are totally new here completing the training will get you a Sniper set. No the setts doesn't give you any bonus, just the enemy can see how rich you are. These decorative items have degree: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Mythical, Immortal, Old and Arcane. This items can be Normal, Auspicious, Heroic, Cursed and Unusual. So these were the decorative items lets talk about the in-game items! You start with 625 gold each hero have their own item build. I recommend you the Healing Slave, Tango and clarity items, this items will fill your HP or your mana. If you are new or never played that hero before i recommend you the guides (Up left the book icon). I recommend you the builds or builds.
Thank you for reading this review. #P3D0'#Hungarian#DotA2fan
Dear Boys & Girls!

The most fantastic game that improves skillset used in everyday life!

After a couple of hours I already got the hang of the game. It is a real rewarding piece with a beautiful community that is keen on helping you improve and unleash your hidden potential. Even though I've achieved the highest Badge possible in the game (which is also a great and original idea to somewhat categorize players), I am still reminded day-by-day that I'm pretty new to the game and I should focus on polishing my skills, which is a huge help since I am somewhat a maximalist.

The Dev Team is amazing and fast to reply in cases of bugs, broken things throughout the game that would otherwise alter the potential outcome of important Ranked Matches. I would highly recommend it to people thinking about taking up a semester abroad or such since it does help You enourmously when it comes to foreign languages.

After just 2 years I was fluent in Russian and Spanish even though I have never taken a class before and this allowed me to travel to St Petersburg and Barcelona taking my language skills to the next level. It's easy to make friends, people have no prejudice when it comes to your Badge, Divine (highest rank in the system) players play with Heralds (lowest rank in the system) and enjoy spending some free time with their fellow bratushki.

I would also like to thank Valve for the amazing support towards amateur and semi-professional teams, the sponsoring of various national tournaments all over the globe and the ability to connect with each other in real life through this amazing franchise.


- The game rewards You trying really hard to win games and works on pushing you even further. The higher your impact in games, the lower impact people it will match with you, resulting in you having to push even harder. Amazing!

- Understand people from all over the globe through simple words, hieroglyphs, and ancient text. Being able to acquire and share information in a new and intuitive way.

- Some people take the role of the good soldier and some that of the leader. With Power however comes Great Responsibility. You are ready to make calls and lead your team towards victory? Keep in mind that you will also be accounted for the consequences of a miscall. But in the end you will become more daring and even better at leading with example!

- The more you play the more advanced you become and analysis, prediction and understanding of movement and thoughts of people you have never met before. Paired with your glorious Communication Skills you will be able to share and respond to any situation. You will effectively be able to see the future as it is!

- While most games are circa 30 minutes long, in some games you spend a wonderful 1,5 hrs time together with 9 other nice people who you learn to know during this experience. The longer the game lasts however, the harder it becomes since any small mistake you make can be the end of the struggle. You acquire the ability called Laser Focus: eyes on the goal, maximum efficiency, 0 error factor. High level players have iron nerves!

- As human beings we must understand that sometimes we win and sometimes we learn. After lost games we still are eager to learn from our mistakes, commend the people that accounted for the win on the opposing team and pat the weaker players on the back. Standing up after a failure is a key factor in creating something new, in evolving. DotA is a major enhancement in this area.

Give it a try, enjoy your time and who knows we might meet in game! ;)
Cheers,
Imagine yourself trapped in a sewer swimming around eating nothing but turds your entire life, each turd represents an average public game. Now imagine after all of those turds you go to eat the another one and to your surpise it is a chocolate bar, it is the best feeling in the world. That chocolate bar represents those occasional games where everyone is evenly skilled and tastes so good that you continue eating turds just hoping for that next chocolate bar.

10/10 Best language learning tool.
I fail my exams, I almost lost communication with my family and friends..became lifeless and reached 2k+ hours on Dota 2 and still have no regrets. 11/10 would die playing for this game. FYI this game is worst than drugs. Once you get in, your never coming back...

Best Play Games with Russians simulator I've ever played.
Dota2 community is seriously the best I've ever seen for my entire life. They're so concerned with us players to the point that they ask are you blind, are you stupid? Never in my life have I've seen someone who asked me such thing, it touched my heart. They're legit concerned that if I'm blind and stupid, probably they wan't to take me to the hospital if I really am. They even suggest to delete the game as I'm playing it too much! Best!
Supporting in dota 2 is like chemistry

If it's easy you're doing it wrong
You should buy some hats.
I think players of this game keep sharing my mothers private number, everyone seems to have had sex with her...
Oh yea and about the game...Very good.
Really great game. If you love racing games that focus on realism and physics, this is the game for you. Has over 100+ cars to race with. Usually a 10 man race to the finish. Alot better then Forza.
Causes anxiety problems, low self esteem, Tourette's syndrome, mood swings, Bipolar disorder, breakdown of relationships, raging erections, racism. Would definitely recommend.
Thought you liked Russians?

Hahahahahahahahahahaha!
while the rest of you picked carry
my eyes became teary
i bought that donkey
i bought those wards
4 tangos and 3 branches are all i got

i did those pull
i did those deny
but wtf you just died

the mid pudge wants me to ward the runes
but the donkey is still crawling

they call me noob for not buying wards
but a gold per second is all i get
and i dont even have my boots yet
Pros:
-Learned Russian
-Learned %99 of entire world are Russians
-Learned how to communicate with emoticons
-Learned how to get trolled
-Learned how to avoid RANKED button
-Learned world is not fair
-Learned C Y K A btw.
Cons:
-C Y K A
Honestly, I really don't know what to say. I've been playing dota2 for a year and it has taught me a lot. Being able to play with your friends is something one can't fanthom. Meeting new people is like a dream come true. It's like a step out from your comfort zone. I love dota2 and its adventures. Collecting cute items like couriers and cute cm sets. It really gives you a sense of value. What I dislike about dota2 is its updates. That would be all.
Things I gave to DotA:
1. Money
2. Time
3. Love

Things DotA gave me:
1. Arthritis
2. Carpal tunnel syndrome
3, Hatred of Russians, Mexicans, Spanish, Finnish, and Russians
4. Broken keyboard
5. Broken mouse
6. 9/10 ready
7. Server crashes
8. 4 stacks of Russians in EUW servers on English prefrence settings
9. Ranked matches
10. Free to play but Pay to win games (I.E. - Foreseer's contract, New Bloom 2015)
11. "It's in the bag" spam (especially Skywrath)
12. Multilingual cursing - I guess this is a good thing?
13. Split second math - Reliable/Unreliable gold and gold loss on death vs. Buyback availability - This is good too

Essentially - DotA is a greedy woman, but I love her all the same.

11 / 10 would play again

Update: Since posting this review back in Feb 2015, a lot has changed in the game. Some of this is irrelevant to the game today. Also, don't take what is wirtten here personally.

Update 2: To all whom think that I copied this off someone else's review, look at the date at which my review was posted and then look at the others.
I find it funny that people like my review so much they plagiarize it.
Just so you know, I wrote it while on the toliet. :^)
I feel myself becoming more Russian every time i play this game... 10/10

Yeah, I think I'll reccomend this game. 12/10
So much fun that you'll lose your mind and before you know it you've spent 2000 hours on it and you're left an empty shell of the person you were. This game is not for the faint hearted. You will be abused, beaten, broken, griefed, tormented and hated on the entire time, and yet you can't stop playing because of the high you get when you win an 80 minute comeback game against mega creeps and divine rapiers. This must be how drug addicts feel.

But is it worth it?

Dota 2 takes sane men and turns them into vile despicable human beings and you have to play with and against such people on a regular basis. To win you must now become captain of the SS dumbf**k and somehow try to convince your teammates fighting the enemy team and not their own is in their best interest.It's also got he highest concentration of Dunning�Kruger patients in the entire online gamming community. Valve's terrible low priority system doesn't help.

Assuming you're a masochist and you aren't deterred by all of the above, you get to experience probably the best free online multiplayer game on the planet. With dota 2 you get...... 115 heroes, 100+ items,hundreds of 5 hero strategies, tens of thousands of lane matchups and infinite replayability. You can and will spend years just learning about each of them. Dota 2 has a thriving pro scene with the international giving out the biggest prize pools in all of esports and many regular sports. New patches and compendiums keep the gameplay fresh for most of the year. The latest international had a 95.5% pick rate of heroes which is a testament to how well the game is balanced.
And if you're a gambling man, dota 2 is just the game for you. Introducing more lootboxes than any other game you've ever seen! Want literally any cosmetic in the game? Well there is a lootbox with your name on it waiting to be opened gabeN.

Just remember no matter how good you get at dota, you're never good enough....and you'll end up chasing the mirage of a high mmr and good players while trodding though mud and $h1t and you never realize it's not real till you're in too deep.
I wish from the very deep of my heart for every single feeder/toxic player/match ruiner to get CANCER FOR REAL AND DIE AND ROT SLOWLIE WITH A PAINFUL AGONY!!!

Dota 2 - Russian Language Simulator

41 / 10
I originally played Dota when it was merely a UMS on WC3, so take this review for what it's worth.

Dota 2 is an addictive experience; however, this game also draws a player base from the bottom of society. If that statement is an insufficient description of the game, continue reading.

This game is not for the casual gamer, this game is for those who have the capability to log in hundreds of hours into a game.
If you play this game, I can attest that there will be times you love it and times you just want to break your monitor with your keyboard. I have a few hundred hours into the game and no matter how long you play, no matter what you do, you will encounter someone who will complain about something you're doing poorly or not doing correctly and it may ruin the gameplay for you. I can only recommend this game if you have thick skin or you have friends to play with.

So here are what I consider the pros and cons of the game:

Pros
-This is a very intricate strategy based game that relies heavily on teamwork and timing.

-Free to play with optional cosmetic costs.

-Gameplay always varies due to each individual hero selection. This, in effect, increases replayability tremendously.

-Wonderful voice actors with interesting dialogue choices by the developer.

-Winning matches in this game often triggers the release of dopamine in the reward center in your brain creating the desire to play more. This in effect causes players to really want to win and may be the trigger of many cons of the game.

Cons
-This game has a steep learning curve, believe me, there is way more to this game than you might think at first glance. Unlike hero customization in League of legends, not all heroes are created equal and not all ward placements are either. It can be a little intimidating to think that your team is already at a disadvantage from the hero selection, but thus is DOTA.

-Secondary to the steep learning curve, games tend to be won or lost by the actions of an individual on either team. This can be ameliorated by steam implementing some sort of "fundamentals of gameplay" video instead of the current lackadaisical tutorial they have. Suffice to say, many new players do not understand that every time their hero is killed by the opposing team, the player loses gold and the other team gains gold. This doubles the impact that each individual has for gameplay.

-Unlike other video game developers, Steam does not region lock. This brings about an unforeseen consequence where individuals from any country can join any server despite having a language preference. You can imagine how difficult it is to create a coordinated cohesive team push when there's a Russian only speaker, Spanish only speaker and a Portuguese only speaker on the US WEST server.

-Blame is a word that is thrown around in this game like the word inequality is thrown around in America. Unfortunately, this is by far the worst aspect of the game. The game community has very little to no interaction prior to gameplay or thereafter and there is no review conversation on what an individual can do to improve in the future. More often than not, an individual will oversimplify the ongoing team loss to 1 action by 1 individual because of time constraints and heated emotions.

-There is no team forfeit vote option in game and often you are sitting there for 10-20 minutes as the other team wastes your time despite securing a victory much earlier.


This review is from personal experience and your gameplay may vary. Of course, if you do meet someone ingame who is a decent person, be sure to commend them at the end of the match for their ingame courtesy.

Final Rating:
-Game 9/10
-Game community 3/10
One of the most addicting games I've ever played, paired along with one of the worst online communities I've ever seen.
Not even joking. The only time I didn't have a Russian player in the lobby was when I was playing on the Russian servers.

Russian edit*
Whenever you search for a Dota game a plane flys over Russia and picks 9 random civilians.
Game is okay but I still haven't done all the quests!


EDIT:
Hahaha I never read the comments on this :D really hilarious!
Mostly that I dont have a life and stuff, I'm happy to be informed of this!
People that worry that I dont see the sun, I'm swedish, there's no sun to begin with so dont worry.
People thinking I wasted 10000+ hours of my life, well this is my fulltime job for the last 3 years, streaming dota. I had great fun and made a sustainable income, just like anyone else who loves their job.
You cost your team the game.

Not the guy who went AFK for 30 minutes to chase a goat. Not the person who charged the enemy zerg group alone. Not the idiot who attacked Roshan by themselves. You.

It is always your fault.

Play this with a set group of people you know and trust. Otherwise you shall be thrown into a community where everyone hates eachother, they all think you are the worst player ever even if you are the best on the team, and are never ever responsible for their own screw-ups. Seriously... the sheer volume of rage I have seen players show in this game is unlike anything I've seen anywhere else.

I stay away from this game now not because it is bad, but because ragey people ruin my fun. If you can get past this... it's actually a pretty decent game.

You have been warned. o_o
Dota 2 ranks among few titles that can be classified as truly free-to-play. While many other titles label themselves with this distinction, there are often convenience purchases or some form of power available for real money transactions. While Dota 2 has an extensive cash shop, all offerings are completely cosmetic. HUD options, voice packs and character costumes form the basis of a store lacking even an iota of power or convenience for purchase. All gameplay elements are absolutely free and do not require collection or usage of any kind of in-game currency.

Once a player has determined that they�re ready to commit to a steep learning curve and potential negative interactions with teammates (Again, learn with friends to reduce this aspect), Dota 2 is incredibly enjoyable and possibly one of the best multiplayer games ever made. Every match is different, and watching perfect team fight execution is gaming art. Players have access to a huge range of hero styles and the interactions between teammates and foes are incredibly diverse. It�s twenty to forty-five minutes of gladiatorial bliss, the end result carefully orchestrated from the first enemy tap to the final crushing blow.

Dota 2 can be experienced and enjoyed at multiple levels of engagement, and it�s a title that rewards users for a deep dive. Heavy investment, heavy reward. The barrier to entry isn�t quite as bad as it was years ago, but it would be disingenuous to say that the game doesn�t have a colossal learning curve. As a free-to-play title readily available on Steam, it offers players a frictionless doorway � but the challenge may be keeping new players interested and willing to commit to the epic journey that is learning, playing, and enjoying Dota 2.

The game is in a strong place right now. It�s rewarding and sociable like few other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. The next few months will be crucial: it�s currently the best expression of Valve�s progressive attitude towards players, and if it can continue on that track it describes a future for online gaming that is far more hopeful than the one we�re used to.

Just remember to spend your starting cash, and make sure someone buys the courier. Oh, and when Riki starts showing up in your games, just get some Sentry Wards down and don't run away. Also, you always want a Bottle when in mid-lane, and runes spawn at 0:00 and again every two minutes. Practice last-hitting before you go online. And if you're jungling, memorise where the low-level Creeps are.

Actually, you know what? Forget all that. Just have fun.

I'm sorry, Master, it won't happen again.
It's like hardcore drug use and it destroys lives. Give it a go, what's the worst that could happen?

Well, you could be here 1000 game hours later hating yourself as you queue for another all pick.

Send help. As in TP bottom because they're five manning.
I guess I have to review this game because I've banked so many hours into it. I'll keep it brief.

Dota 2 is probably the most frustrating game ever created. Your team will let you down constantly, the enemy team will consistently pick the heroes you hate playing against the most, you will never get the hat drops you want, and your own mind and body will frequently betray you and make you contend with the fact that you are not nearly as good as you think you are (or, more likely, force you to live in a fantasy dream world where you are as good as you think you are and just blame your teammates some more). It'll turn you into a monster and destroy your life. It'll murder your loved ones and feed them to you.

But you'll play it anyway. You'll ragequit and uninstall and stare at your library of games as the creeping realization sweeps over you that you not playing Dota 2 will not effect the universe in even the smallest way, will have no conceivable effect on anything. You will be filled with a sudden dread that nothing you do matters and life has no meaning. Basically the same feeling you get when you play Dota 2. And Dota 2 will be your only distraction from this dessicated husk of a life. So the next day you'll find yourself drawn back into it like a moth to a flame, staving off the moment when you'll have to face your demons for as long as you can. You will probably die alone some day and nobody will remember how high your MMR was or your sunstrike accuracy.

So what are you waiting for, you worthless peons?! Get out there and dance! DANCE FOR THE PUPPETMASTER GABE! GO EARN YOUR HATS, YOU CRAVEN MONGRELS!

0/10 would not recommend to anyone but can't stop playing and won't be able to stop you either.
700 New interface is WAY too small, did they test it on 2005 monitors or something?
New GUI ruined the game, lost probably more than half the player base, no more synergy in GUI and atmosphere is gone from dota!

Don't know why they changed it like this maybe they don't want to make any money anymore?
Does Valve want to quit supporting Dota 2 in favor of new MOBA maybe?

Skip this game for now it has became tainted (BAD).

edit november 2017, it became even worse

After the most recent major update, they changed the game to LoL 2.0, this is not Dota anymore. End of an era for one of the best moba games. To bad some LoL players have taken over Valve and started to simplify the whole game.
Will make you hate everyone who doesn't speak english. 5/5
The game teaches you how to destroy your life in less than a week.
This game cost me my job, my girlfriend and brung out a horrible side of me I never knew existed.

Good job Valve :D
If you like to watch the hours of your youth drip away like sand through an hour glass, then this is the game for you. If you like watching snotty know it all's get crushed in all too ironic ways by the enemy, then this is the game for you. If you like the sweet sting of success being ruthlessly snatched away from you as the enemy ploughs through your advance on their base like a warm knife through butter, then this game is for you.
If you like low level intensity games, where even if you lose, your pride stays intact, or games that don't have you swearing like a Tarantino film at the screen over the smallest thing....then this game is not for you.

Dota2 is like cyber cocaine.
Best Soviet Union Simulator out there
Can we have the old patch back? I pay for it hahah
To many changes in Patch 7.00!!!!!

Learn Russian for free. 10/10. Better than Rosetta Stone.
Worst game ever.
The most annoying, frustrating, ADDICTIVE game that i've ever played. This game will make you smash your keyboard, throw your mouse agains the walls, scream like a child in front of the computer and most important RAGE like your life depends on that game. But the next day you will still play it with a new keyboard and mouse like nothing happened.


I don't know if i should recommend this game or not :)...hmm i think i should.
As this was my first MOBA game, my first few hours were spent hearing people calling me bad, insulting my mom, and questioning my sexuality. Now after 1000+ hours, I can safely tell others they are bad, tell them to uninstall, and call them ugly.

10/10 game is satisfying after learning.
