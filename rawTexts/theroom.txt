psychologist whats the problem they never say what they mean and they always play games okay what do you mean i have a serious problem with lisa i dont think shes being faithful to me in fact i know she isnt lisa are you sure im sure i overheard a conversation between lisa and her mother and i recorded some phone conversations she had with a guy who has a voice that coincidentally sounds very similar to the voice of mark who is my best friend what should i do peter this is lisa we are talking about yeah are you sure yes what would you like me to say you are a psychologist peter dont you have some advice i am an expert thats true and its not a very complicated situation but johnny you are my friend and i dont want to get between you and lisa look i think you should confront her and show her whos the man of the house i cant confront her i have to give her a second chance after all shes my future wife you know what they say love is blind its not about love johnny its about control and the best way to control a female is to make them emotionally dependent on you you didnt do that so lisa found it somewhere else did you hear the door yeah oh hi mark come in oh hey johnny hey peter we are just talking about women women man women just confuse me cant live with them cant live without them but we need them for baby making i have a girl but shes married shes very attractive its driving me crazy why didnt you mention this before im a psychologist is it anyone i know what do you mean is it someone you know can i meet her why would you want to do that johnny i mean well um what would lisa think its an awkward situation oh i see you mean shes too old or you think i will take her away from you huh no i have my own problems tell me about your problems johnny peter you always play psychologist with us look i may be your friend but by profession i am a psychologist and that makes me an expert on these issues lisa is teasing me about whether we will get married or not and we havent made love in awhile i dont know what to do what kind of man are you johnny people are people sometimes they cant see their own faults so they need someone to tell them you have to give it to her straight it takes two to tango johnny and if all she has are two left feet shell just end up stepping all over your toes youre going to get hurt hey im thinking of moving to a better place man im making some good money look you should tell her the truth you are doing this for your girl right you are right peter is she getting a divorce mark you guys are too much hey are you running bay to breakers this year i am sure no im not going this year ha ha chicken peter you are just a little chicken chip chip chip chip chip ha ha squeak squeak honk little chicken who are you guys calling a chicken i just dont like all the weirdos theres too many weirdos i dont mind mark do you remember the one with the big tits the blonde one how about the one with the bridal gown and the sign oh yeah please marry me i almost took her up on it i never ate so much bread the barbecue chicken and rice was delicious that was cool you guys proved my point you are both weird you guys want to play cards no we cant i expect lisa any minute hey whos king of the house yeah you have to establish these guidelines before you get married how did you meet lisa you never told us its a very interesting story when i moved to san francisco i had two suitcases and i didnt know anyone i hit the ymca with a two thousand dollar check that i couldnt cash why not because it was an out of state bank anyway i was working as a bus boy in a hotel and lisa was sitting drinking her coffee and she was so beautiful and i say hi to her thats how we met so whats the interesting part oh give us a break mark isnt it obvious a two thousand dollar out of state bank issued check that he cant cash ha ha ha thats quite the conundrum ill bet its never been cashed has it youre right peter on both counts i had the uncashed check laminated and placed in a photo album which is indeed very interesting but even more interesting is that lisa was living in san francisco at the time so dont you see mark lisa had her own home in the city she did not need to stay in a hotel she had some kind of inexplicable urge to spend the night in that very hotel during my shift it was meant to be what no tips from your job whatever do you guys want to eat something hey guys whats going on oh hey lisa hey lisa wheres johnny hes in the kitchen i got to go i didnt mean to chase you off i wish youd stick around for awhile are you crazy i have to be at work early see ya why are you sitting on the floor billy its hard to explain you wouldnt understand you son of a bitch what the hell is the matter with you youre the reason i drink if you dont get up this instant im going to belt whip you so hard youll wish you were going to the moon there are you happy now i am happy look billy i have to talk to johnny ill see you later will you tell him i said hello alright yes oh hi mark whats happening hi peter this is a good place to think huh you wanna put me on the clock whats that you want some no man you know i dont

affair with lisa am i wrong wake up man wake up what are you doing are you crazy im sorry i didnt mean it youre my best friend are you okay dont worry about it lets just talk about your problem are you sure youre okay why do you want to know my secret well youre right its lisa i dont know what to do im so depressed i think ill kill myself johnny is my best friend shes so manipulative how did this happen if johnny finds out that will be the end of your friendship what were you thinking look life is very complex but you have to face it you should have to be responsible my advice to you is that you should stop thinking about her and never do sex with her find another girl thats my advice lisas a sociopath she only cares about herself and shes incapable of loving anyone whatever peter lets go oh thank you thanks a lot oh hi billy that was some funeral wasnt it yeah im just glad its over billy we had to make sure jimmy was really dead now that we all saw him lain down in that funeral casket we can be sure hell never trouble you ever again for his money theres just some things i dont understand johnny like what death the meaning of life love no i mean what happened at the police station didnt you take jimmy straight there its all very strange well you know the police have to deal with all sorts of crazy people so sometimes at the station the police have to do what may seem to us like some strange things but they said all his blood was sucked out of his body some very strange things hey peter come in its too bad about jimmy i know he was a bad guy but that was just crazy besides funerals are so depressing hey thats life have a seat peter wow wow hey guys you like it you look great you look like babyface whats the occasion mark i started a new job and they told
