not much. i'm just sitting up here thinking about life. i wonder if girls like to cheat like guys do? what makes you say that? well, i'm just thinking, you know. i don't have to worry about that because lisa is loyal to me. you never know. people are very strange this days. i used to know a girl who had a dozen guys. one of them found out about it, beat her up and she ended up in a hospital. what a story!  you can say that again. i'm so lucky i have you as my best friend and i love lisa so much . yeah man, you are lucky. very .... lucky . you should have a girl mark. yeah, i guess you're right. maybe i have one already. i don't know yet. well what happened to that girl? remember? betty? that's her name, isn't it? betty? yeah . yeah, we don't see each other anymore. besides she wasn't any good in bed. she was beautiful, but we had too many arguments .  that's too bad. my lisa is great when i can get it. i just can't figure women out. sometimes they're smart, sometimes they're dumb. sometimes they're good, sometimes they're bad. sometimes they're nice, sometimes they're not nice. they are evil, seductive and hostile. seems to me like you're an expert on this. nooooo . i'm definitely not an expert. what's bothering you mark? nothing man! forget it! is it some secrets mark? why don't you tell me? we are like brothers, we shouldn't have secrets.  no forget it. i'll talk to you later! so, i'm organizing a party for johnny's birthday. can you come? when is it? next friday at six. it's a surprise. you can bring someone if you want. well, sure, i can come, but i don't know if i'll bring anybody. oh that jerk harold, he wants me to give him a share of my house. that house belongs to me, he has no right. i'm not giving him a penny. who does he think he is? he's your brother. he is always bugging me about my house. fifteen years ago we agreed that house belongs to me. now the value of the house is going up and he's seeing dollar signs. everything goes wrong at once. nobody wants to help me and i'm dying. we already discussed this. you're not dying mom.  i am lisa. i finally got the results of the test back. i definitely have breast cancer. look, don't worry about it, everything will be fine. they are curing lots of people everyday and johnny says it's not a big deal anymore . i'm sure he's right. i'll be fine. oh i heard edward is talking about me. he is a hateful man. i'm so glad i divorced him. i really think he gave me the breast cancer after he slept with that hooker. that type of riffraff carry all sorts of things. don't you agree? look, don't worry about it. you just concentrate on getting well . well at least you have a good man. you're wrong, mom. he's not what you think he is. he didn't get his promotion, and he got drunk last night and he hit me. johhny doesn't drink. what are you talking about? he did last night, and i don't love him anymore. johnny is your financial security. you can't afford to ignore this . yeah, ok mom. can i just talk to you later?  you don't want to talk to me. i just got done talking with a client and i have to get ready to meet him. can i just talk to you later?

oh, that's nothing. homework? don't worry about it. if i were a burglar, you would be my best friend. look, i don't want to talk about it. you know, i worry about you. i have to go home. don't you ever have sex with that bran character. homework indeed.  ok , mom . bye, bye. i need a drink. hey billy. jimmy! i've been looking for you. yeah, sure you have. you have my money right. yeah it's coming. it'll be here in a few minutes. what do you mean it's coming billy?

you can love someone deep inside your heart and there is nothing wrong with it. if a lot of people love each other, the world will be a better place to live. but you're lisa's future husband.  billy, don't worry about it. the important thing is that you appreciate loyalty. you would never betray me and that's why i do things like pay your rent for you. in fact, and this is a secret, i have a small fortune built up that i'm waiting to give away as a reward to all my friends who never betray me. you mean you are not upset at me?

maybe i'll change my mind. don't talk like that. what do you mean? what do you think? women change their minds all the time. ha, ha! you must be kidding, aren't you? look, i don't want to talk about it. i'm going to go upstairs, wash up and go to bed. how dare you talk to me like that! you should tell me everything! what is it you don't want to talk about?

i didn't get much sleep last night. why not? what's wrong? you remember my friend shirley hamilton? she wants to buy a new house and i asked johnny if he could help her with the down payment. all he can tell me is that it's an awkward situation. i expected your husband to be a little more generous . he's not my husband. i know, but johnny is part of our family.  mom, i don't love johnny anymore. i don't even like him. i had sex with someone else. you can't be serious. you don't understand. who, who is it? i don't want to talk about it. oh no! it's that homework character with the underwear, isn't it! i gave you strict orders not to sleep with that goof ball. well, that's it. you leave me no other option than to disown y . . . it's not bran! look, i just don't want to talk about it. you don't want to talk about it. then why did you bring it up in the first place? have you lost your mind? next thing you'll be turning tricks like your brother. i don't know why i brought it up?  you don't know? you really are going crazy. i have to go pick up my breast cancer medicine. can you believe it's going to cost me  .? i think the whole thing was made up just so they can make some easy money. imagine, taking advantage of an old defenseless lady who's losing her life. mom, just take the medicine and you'll be fine. are you coming to the party? sure, i suppose so. how can they say this about me? i don't believe it. lisa has been unfaithful and that woman, her mother, cares more about her life threatening cancer than she does about me. i'll show them. i'll record everything.  hey johnny, what's going on? oh hi bran, what's new? actually johnny, i got a little bit of a tragedy on my hands. did michelle betray you or something? no, nothing horrible like that! i'd probably kill myself if she ever did that. who wouldn't? so tell me what happened. me and michelle were making out, at your place. uh huh. and lisa and claudette sort of walked in on us in the middle of it. that's not the end of the story. go on, i'm listening. we're going at it and i get out of there as fast as possible. i get my pants, i get my shirt, and i get out of there. and then about half way down the stairs, i realize that i had misplaced, i had forgotten something ... .my underwear.  underwear? so i come back to get it, you know, and i pretend that i need a book, you know i'm looking for my book. i reach in and put the underwear in my pocket and it sort of slides out, and claudette, she saw it sticking out of my pocket, and she pulls it out and she's showing everybody me underwears. you must be kidding. underwear, i got the picture. i don't know what to do? underwear, that's life. hey johnny. hey billy. do you guys want to play some football? i have to go see michelle in a little bit, to make out with her. so i'm sorry. oh come on ! what's the matter bran, are you chicken? chip! chip!!!  ha ha! chip! ! ! chip! ! ! ! ha ha! oh hi mark! okay guys , whatever . hey what's up mark? hey billy, what's up? let ' s go for it . i'm going out. sorry you had to see that. i'm not sorry.  studying right? i don't study like that. i bet you wish you did. catch it. what's going on you guys? he's just telling us about an underwear issue. underwear? what's that? it's embarrassing man. i don't want to get into it. underwear .... it ' s the underpants man! does anyone know cpr? i do! bran, are you okay?  are you okay? i'm fine. sure? uh huh. do you want to go see a doctor? no, no, no. i'm good, i'm alright. i'm fine. yeah mark, take him to a doctor, and bran, listen if you need anything call me anytime alright. we are very good friends and i will do everything in my power to help you get better. take care of him mark! oh man.... oh man, oh man. onward, christian soldiers, marching as to war....  oh hi peter, i'm so glad you stopped by. come in and have a seat. i'll get some water for us to drink. i don't understand women. do you peter? of course i do . i'm a psychologist. what's the problem? they never say what they mean, and they always play games. okay, what do you mean? i have a serious problem with lisa. i don't think she's being faithful to me. in fact, i know she isn't. lisa? are you sure?  i'm sure. i overheard a conversation between lisa and her mother, and i recorded some phone conversations she had with a guy who has a voice that coincidentally sounds very similar to the voice of mark, who is my best friend. what should i do peter? this is lisa we are talking about? yeah . are you sure? yes . what would you like me to say? you are a psychologist, peter. don't you have some advice? i am an expert, that's true, and it's not a very complicated situation. but johnny, you are my friend and i don't want to get between you and lisa. look, i think you should confront her and show her who's the man of the house. i can't confront her, i have to give her a second chance. after all she's my future wife. you know what they say, love is blind.  it's not about love, johnny. it's about control, and the best way to control a female is to make them emotionally dependent on you. you didn't do that, so lisa found it somewhere else. did you hear the door? yeah . oh hi mark, come in. oh hey johnny. hey peter. we are just talking about women. women, man, women just confuse me. can’t live with them, can't live without them, but we need them for baby making. i have a girl, but she's married. she's very attractive. it's driving me crazy. why didn't you mention this before? i'm a psychologist. is it anyone i know? what do you mean, is it someone you know?  can i meet her? why would you want to do that, johnny? i mean, well, um, what would lisa think? it's an awkward situation. oh i see. you mean she's too old or you think i will take her away from you? huh? no! i have my own problems. tell me about your problems johnny. peter, you always play psychologist with us. look, i may be your friend, but by profession i am a psychologist, and that makes me an expert on these issues. lisa is teasing me about whether we will get married or not, and we haven't made love in awhile. i don't know what to do. what kind of man are you johnny? people are people. sometimes they can't see their own faults, so they need someone to tell them. you have to give it to her straight. it takes two to tango johnny, and if all she has are two left feet she'll just end up stepping all over your toes. you're going to get hurt .  hey i'm thinking of moving to a better place man. i'm making some good money. look, you should tell her the truth. you are doing this for your girl, right? you are right peter! is she getting a divorce mark? you guys are too much! hey, are you running bay to breakers this year? i am, sure. no, i'm not going this year. ha, ha!! chicken peter, you are just a little chicken!!! chip!!! chip!!! chip!!!! chip!!!!! chip!!!! ha ha! ! squeak! ! ! squeak! ! ! ! honk! ! ! little chicken! ! ! who are you guys calling a chicken? i just don't like all the weirdos. there's too many weirdos. i don't mind. mark, do you remember the one with the big tits, the blonde one? how about the one with the bridal gown and the sign?  oh yeah, please marry me. i almost took her up on it. i never ate so much bread. the barbecue chicken and rice was delicious. that was cool. you guys proved my point. you are both weird. you guys want to play cards? no, we can't. i expect lisa any minute. hey, who's king of the house? yeah, you have to establish these guidelines before you get married. how did you meet lisa? you never told us. it's a very interesting story. when i moved to san francisco i had two suitcases and i didn't know anyone. i hit the ymca with a two thousand dollar check that i couldn't cash. why not? because it was an out of state bank. anyway, i was working as a bus boy in a hotel and lisa was sitting, drinking her coffee and she was so beautiful, and i say hi to her. that's how we met. so, what's the interesting part?  oh give us a break mark! isn't it obvious? a two thousand dollar out of state bank issued check that he can't cash? ha ha ha! that's quite the conundrum. i'll bet it's never been cashed, has it. you're right peter, on both counts. i had the uncashed check laminated and placed in a photo album, which is indeed very interesting. but, even more interesting is that lisa was living in san francisco at the time. so? don't you see, mark? lisa had her own home in the city. she did not need to stay in a hotel. she had some kind of inexplicable urge to spend the night in that very hotel, during my shift. it was meant to be! what, no tips from your job? whatever, do you guys want to eat something? hey guys. what's going on?  oh, hey lisa. hey lisa. where's johnny? he's in the kitchen. i got to go. i didn't mean to chase you off. i wish you'd stick around for awhile . are you crazy? i have to be at work early. see ya. why are you sitting on the floor billy? it's hard to explain, you wouldn't understand. you son of a bitch!!! what the hell is the matter with you!? you're the reason i drink! if you don't get up this instant i'm going to belt whip you so hard you'll wish you were going to the moon!  there, are you happy now? i am happy!!! look billy! i have to talk to johnny! i'll see you later ! ! ! will you tell him i said hello? alright! ! ! yes ! oh, hi mark. what's happening? hi peter. this is a good place to think, huh?  you wanna put me on the clock? what's that? you want some? no man. you know i don't smoke that stuff. you look depressed. i got this sick feeling in my stomach. i did something awful. i just can't forgive myself. why don't you tell me about it? well, i feel like running, or killing myself. something crazy like that. why are you smoking that crap? no wonder you can't think straight. that stuff will mess up your brain. anyway, it's none of your business. why are you so nosy? you think you know everything. you don't know shit.  just a minute. who do you think you are? you're acting like a kid. grow up. who are you calling a kid? fuck you! cool it mark. i'm just trying to help you. i know you're having an affair with lisa. am i wrong? wake up man. wake up what are you doing? are you crazy? i'm sorry, i didn't mean it. you're my best friend. are you okay? don't worry about it. let's just talk about your problem.  are you sure you're okay? why do you want to know my secret? well, you're right, it's lisa. i don't know what to do . i'm so depressed. i think i'll kill myself. johnny is my best friend. she's so manipulative. how did this happen? if johnny finds out that will be the end of your friendship. what were you thinking? look, life is very complex, but you have to face it. you should have to be responsible. my advice to you is that you should stop thinking about her, and never do sex with her. find another girl. that's my advice. lisa's a sociopath. she only cares about herself, and she's incapable of loving anyone. whatever peter. let's go. oh thank you. thanks a lot. oh hi billy. that was some funeral wasn't it. yeah, i'm just glad it's over.  billy, we had to make sure jimmy was really dead. now that we all saw him lain down in that funeral casket we can be sure he'll never trouble you ever again for his money. there's just some things i don't understand johnny. like what? death? the meaning of life? love? no, i mean what happened at the police station. didn't you take jimmy straight there? it's all very strange. well you know, the police have to deal with all sorts of crazy people. so, sometimes at the station the police have to do what may seem to us like some strange things. but they said all his blood was sucked out of his body. some very .... strange things. hey peter, come in. it's too bad about jimmy. i know he was a bad guy, but that was just crazy. besides, funerals are so depressing. hey that's life. have a seat peter.  wow! wow! hey guys. you like it? you look great. you look like babyface. what's the occasion mark? i started a new job and they told me i can't show up there looking like a caveman. so there you have it. what did you think of the funeral mark? we were looking for you. what funeral? okay hey, you guys want to play some catch the football? in tuxes, you gotta be kidding?  come on mark, let's do it. i ' m up for it . johnny? ask mr. glasses-head over there. come on peter . no, i don't think so. please?? come on. chip!!!!!  catch johnny! nice snag! all right peter! here we go mark! come on ! catch mark. mark winds up and motions to peter that he’s going to throw go , go . . . gee mark, why don't you try not hurting someone for a change. it's not his fault. it's those damn drugs! come on, let's go see a doctor. bye lisa.  hello mom. how are you? i'm okay. how are you? there it us again. what are you talking about? that clicking noise. the phone's been making a strange sound lately . you should report it to the phone company. utilities are very expensive these days. did you call a repair technician? no, i think i'll just by a new phone. there's a radio-shack nearby . well, as long as johnny's paying for it. so, how are you? i'm fixing the apartment for johnny's birthday, but i'm really not into it. why not?  oh, i don’t want to get married. i love mark. don't you understand that? it's not right lisa. you should still keep johnny because he's very independent, and you ain't. think about the money. yeah, but i'm not happy anymore. before i met mark i didn't think he would blow my mind. what are you talking about? you weren't meant to be happy. i haven't been happy since i got married for the first time. i didn't want to marry your dad either. i've been miserable since then. it's true, men are all assholes. you have to use them and abuse them. there's nothing wrong with that. i know. johnny's okay, and i have him wrapped around my little finger. well, then you should be happy. but, i don't love him. don't throw your life away just because you don't love him. that's ridiculous. you've got to grow up and listen to me. okay, i'll see you at the party then. bye .  hi, can i have a hot chocolate please? oh hi johnny! i didn't know it was you. what size would you like? medium. sure . how about you? i'll have a mint tea. medium also? whatever floats your boat. go sit down. we'll be right there. man, i'm so tired of girl's games.  what happened now mark? relationships never work man, i don't know why i waste my time . what makes you say that? it's not that easy johnny. well, you should be happy mark. yeah i know. life is too short. maybe for you it is . oh thank you susan. you're welcome. now how about something you can really get into with a fork, like cheesecake? no! no, not today, maybe some other day. but thanks for thinking about it .   all right reserved real good. okay then. fine, alright. how was work today? pretty good. we got a new client and the bank will make a lot of money. what client?

he tried to rape me, but i didn't let him. did you tell johnny yet? no, they are good friends. i know. tricky! tricky! you know, i really loved johnny at first. really? i thought you loved him now. until now i did. i think i still love him. everything's changed. i need more from life than what johnny can give me. suddenly my eyes are wide open and i see the light. i want it all.  do you think you can get it all from mark? i want to play the field. if he doesn't give me what i want then somebody else will. i think i don't know you anymore. you are being so manipulative lisa. so what, you can learn from me. you have to take as much as you can. you have to live, live, live my friend. don't worry, i have everything covered. tell me more. maybe i can understand your point of view. look, i don't want to talk about it. let's put this stuff in bowls. we only have an hour before people start coming. i want to know, it's important to me. you're my best friend. this really upsets me.  i don't know what the big mystery is. doesn't everybody look out for number one? aren't i worth it? don't i deserve the best? i can't do that. you are too much for me lisa. you're not such an angel yourself. we're not talking about me. stop it, they'll be here any minute. are you trying to ruin my party? i'm with you, let's talk later. it looks to me like we're ready. we sure fooled johnny, didn't we. he doesn't suspect a thing! we could carry on right under his nose and he wouldn't be the wiser. he still thinks i'm his best friend!  johnny does whatever i tell him. i have him totally whipped. the best part is he totally trusts me and thinks i will never betray him. i know. what a dope! har har har!!! he's as good in bed as he is at getting promotions.... awful! hi honey, happy birthday! thank you. surprise ! ! ! happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you... oh wow!  happy birthday dear johnny... wow, alright, thank you. . happy birthday to you. . thank you, thank you. and many more . . . . ! i'll talk to you later.  hey everybody, let's go outside for some fresh air! wait, i have something i want to show you. what is it?

'my' stupid comments!? here's some words of wisdom for you, you comment making idiot. you think your opinions are so important and that you possess some natural-born expertise. but take it from me, a real expert, when i say that your comments are even more stupider than you, the very person making them. now, i have a lot of experience, so when i say something, it counts. that's because i'm very important and i know what i'm talking about, unlike feeble-minded you. i see you want to make a retort with a comment, do you? pshaw!!! you can't make a comment because you're speechless, and you're too afraid. besides, no one wants to hear your stupidness anyway.  do you understand what you are doing? you are going to destroy johnny. he is very sensitive. i don't care. i'm in love with mark. how can you do this? you make me sick! thank you honey, this is a beautiful party. you invited all my friends. good thinking. you're welcome darling. you know how much i love you. i do, ha ha ha. you know, it's getting really hot in here. why don't we go back outside. uh huh.   all right reserved hey everybody, i have an announcement to make. we are expecting ! lisa, you have to be honest with johnny. i agree with that. you know what's going on?

this is just getting worse and worse. i feel like i'm sitting on an atomic bomb waiting for it to go off. me too. there's no simple solution to this. don't worry. you guys worry entirely too much about me. lisa, we're not worried about you, we are worried about johnny. you don't understand the psychological impact of what you are doing here. you're hurting yourself, you are hurting our friendship. actually it's more like a thermonuclear bomb i'm sitting on, using the primary fission reaction from the atomic bomb i was previously sitting on to compress and ignite a secondary hydrogen based fusion reaction. i am not responsible for johnny. i'm through with that. i'm changing, the whole world's changing. i have the right, don't i? people are changing all the time. i have to think about my future. what's it to you?  this is going to pull us all down, it's going to shake up our group of friends. it's going to destroy our friendship lisa, it's going to destroy everything, just like in that movie. dr. strangelove. except, i don't think mark really loves you. i don't want to talk about it! lisa, you are going to have to face it. i for one, am going to have a hard time forgiving you if you don't. hey everybody, let's go inside and eat some cake! i don't understand you lisa. women. they're all the same. lisa looks hot tonight.  come on, who's baby is it lisa?
