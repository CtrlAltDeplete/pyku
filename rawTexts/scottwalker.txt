Mama, do you see what I see
On your knees and pray for me
Mathilde's come back to me
Charley, don't want another beer
Tonight I'm gonna drink my tears
Mathilde's come back to me
Go ask the maid if she heard what I said
Tell her to change the sheets on the bed
Mathilde's come back to me
Fellas, don't leave me tonight
Tonight I'm going back to fight
Wretched Mathilde's in sight

My heart, my heart, stop beating so
Just make as if you didn't know
That Mathilde's come back to me
My heart, I don't want you to say
She's lovelier than when she went away
Mathilde, who's come back to me
My heart, stop beating overjoyed
Remember you were once destroyed
By Mathilde, who's come back to me
Fellas, please don't go away
Tell me that I mustn't stay
Mathilde's coming back today

My hands, you'll start to shake again
When you remember all the pain
Mathilde's come back to me
You'll want to beat her black and blue
But don't do it, I beg of you
Mathilde's come back to me
My hands, remember all the years
Remember when you caught my tears
Mathilde's come back to me
My hands, you'll want to touch her now
But please try and be strong somehow
Mathilde's here, she's coming now, now

Mama, can you hear me yell
Your baby boy's gone back to hell
Mathilde's come back to me
Charley, champagne right away
I know you've been saving it for the holiday
But Mathilde's come back to me
Go ask the maid if she heard what I said
Tell her to put the best sheets on the bed
Mathilde's come back to me
My friends, don't count on me no more
I've gone and crashed through heaven's door
My sweet Mathilde's here
Once more, once more

The little clock's stopped ticking now
We're swallowed in the stomached rue
The only sound to tear the night
Comes from the man upstairs

His bloated belching figure stomps
He may crash through the ceiling soon
The window sees trees cry from cold
And claw the moon

But we know don't we
And we'll dream won't we
Of Montague Terrace in blue

The girl across the hall makes love
Her thoughts lay cold like shattered stone
Her thighs are full of tales to tell
Of all the nights she's known

Your eyes ignite like cold blue fire
The scent of secrets everywhere
A fist filled with illusions
Clutches all our cares

But we know don't we
And we'll dream won't we
Of Montague Terrace in blue oh in blue

Each night I meant to say
I'd missed her through the day
But I'd forget it
I never said it

I passed the flower shop
Lord knows I meant to stop
But I'd say tomorrow
Perhaps tomorrow

Tomorrow there'd be time
There'd always be another spring
Time to make her laughter ring
Time to give her everything

Oh my Angelica, my Angelica
There's so much you never knew
So much I always meant to say
And do, for you, for you
Angelica

And then the cold winds came
And when I spoke her name
And felt her near me
She couldn't hear me

Her shadow had been cast
Too many springs had passed
For Angelica
Sweet Angelica

Now in my solitude
I tend the flowers that I buy
As they slowly fade and die
Watered by the tears I cry

For my Angelica, my Angelica
There's so much you never knew
So much I always meant to say
And do, for you, for you
Angelica
Angelica
Angelica
Angelica

Lady came from Baltimore
All she wore was lace
Didn't know that I was poor
She never saw my place

I was there to steal the money
Take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady
Got away with none

Lady's name was Susan Moore
Daddy was the law
Didn't know that I was poor
And lived outside the law

Daddy said I was a thief
Didn't have the love
But I was Susan's true belief
Married her for love

I was there to steal the money
Take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady
Got away with none

Now she lived and built a wall
To keep the robbers out
Didn't care a thing at all
That's what I'm about

I was there to steal the money
Take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady
Got away with none

Then I fell in love with the lady
Got away with none


Today is just another day
Tomorrow is a guess
But yesterday
Oh what I'd give for yesterday
To relive one yesterday
And its happiness

When Joanna loved me
Every town was Paris
Every day was Sunday
Every month was May

When Joanna loved me
Every sound was music
Music made of laughter
Laughter that was bright and gay
But when Joanna left me
May became December

But even in December
I remember
Her touch
Her smile
And for a little while
She loves me

And once again its Paris
Paris on a Sunday
And the month is May

My death is like
a swinging door
a patient girl who knows the score
whistle for her
and the passing time

My death waits like
a bible truth
at the funeral of my youth
weep loud for that
and the passing time

My death waits like
a witch at night
and surely as our love is bright
let's laugh for us
and the passing time

But whatever is behind the door
there is nothing much to do
angel or devil I don't care
for in front of that door
there is you

My death waits like
a beggar blind
who sees the world with an unlit mind
throw him a dime
for the passing time

My death waits
to allow my friends
a few good times before it ends
let's drink to that
and the passing time

My death waits in
your arms, your thighs
your cool fingers will close my eyes
let's not talk about
the passing time

But whatever is behind the door
there is nothing much to do
angel or devil I don't care
for in front of that door
there is you

My death waits
among the falling leaves
in magicians, mysterious sleeves
rabbits, dogs
and the passing time

My death waits
among the flowers
where the blackest shadow cowers
let's pick lilacs
for the passing time

My death waits in
a double bed
sails of oblivion at my head
pull up the sheets
against the passing time

But whatever is behind the door
there is nothing much to do
angel or devil I don't care
for in front of that door
there is you


Now it begins, now that's you've gone
Needles and pins, twilight till dawn
Watching the clock till you return
Lighting that torch and watching it burn

Now it begins, day after day
This is my life, ticking away
Waiting to hear footsteps that say
Love will appear and this time to stay

Each time you go
I try to pretend
It's over at last
And this time the big hurt will end

Now it begins, now that's you've gone
Needles and pins, twilight till dawn
But if you don't come back again
I'll wonder when, oh when will it end
The Big Hurt
The Big Hurt
The Big Hurt

Mist falls and his voice cracks from the morning
Flowers and my body feels like lead
Someone should have stopped the birds from singing today
Hammers from striking nails into clay

Her face penetrates the blue gray morning
Her eyes pregnant pools produce a tear
Someone should have shouted you had gone in her ear
That summer was stolen away

Such a small love
Such a little tear
You would laugh so loud
If you could see us here

With my one suit
Badly pressed and worn
Like a child left
In the world alone

He speaks I don't hear a word he's saying
Hang on to the pine trees and the snow
Reach out grab the memories that are left for your hand
They'll help you get by for a while

Such a small love
Such a little tear
Is this all that's left
On your cheek so pale

His shallow half lit eyes
His rotted teeth grown on
Our drunken madman nights
Ending up in jail

Midnight mornings
Drenched in day-glo red
Words colliding
Things we left unsaid

Perfumed pillows
Girls that clung so near
Such a small love
Such a little tear

Move over sun
And give some sky
I've got me some wings
I'm eager to try
I may be unknown
But wait til I've flown

You're gonna hear from me

Make me some room
You people up there
On top of the world
I'll meet you, I swear
I'm staking my claim
Remember my name

You're gonna hear from me

Fortune smiles
On the road before me

I'm fortunes child
Listen world you cant ignore me

I've got a song
That wants to be played
Raise up a flag
Begin my parade
Then watch the world over
Start coming up clover

That how it's gonna be
You'll see

You're gonna hear from me

Through a long and sleepless night
I whisper your name
Through a long and sleepless night
Of who is to blame
Can't help but wonder
If you're lonely too
As I lie here and toss about
So at a loss without you

How I wish, my heart would leave
My memories alone
Why must I re-dream, re-live
The Joys we have known

I pray that someday
Our love will see the light
Till then
In tick-tock silence
I'll beg my heart to weep less
All through an oh so long and sleepless night

I pray that someday
Our love will see the light
Till then
In tick-tock silence
I'll beg my heart to weep less
All through an oh so long and sleepless night

What was it like when we were young
Sleeping in each others arms
Walking in each others dreams
Was it only yesterday
I've forgotten anyway

What was it like to hear your name
Where's the girl that I once knew
Running home thru winter parks
Arm in Arm and heart in heart
Now like children in the dark
We hold hands and watch the rain

When you kissed my eyes awake
Running mornings crowded streets
Just to find we've missed our bus
but we'd laugh, kiss, what the hell

When you'd burst in from the rain
Clasp my head between your hands,
kiss away the darkest day
Always there to understand.
You could make me proud again

Now I go aimlessly at night
Sleep with faces I don't know
Always coming back to you
and the shadows of this room

I must search you eyes again
Just to find that they are dead

Always coming back to you

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sleeps
While the riverbank weeps with the old willow tree
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries in a drunken down fight
And in the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fishheads and tails
He will show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can swallow the moon, that can haul up the sails
And he yells to the cook with his arms open wide
Bring me more fish put it down by my side
Then he wants so to belch but he's too full to try
So he gets up and laughs and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
Then out to the night with their pride in their pants
With the slut that they tow underneath the street lamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men
They've bargained their bodies and their virtue long gone
For a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on
He plants his nose in the sky and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam

And if one day I should become
A singer with a Spanish bum
Who sings for women of great virtue
I'd sing to them with a guitar
I borrowed from a coffee bar
Well, what you don't know doesn't hurt you
My name would be Antonio
And all my bridges I would burn
And when I gave them some they'd know
I'd expect something in return
I'd have to get drunk every night
And talk about virility
With some old grandmother
That might be decked out like a christmas tree
And though pink elephants I'd see
Though I'd be drunk as I could be
Still I would sing my song to me
About the time they called me "Jacky"

If I could be for only an hour
If I could be for an hour every day
If I could be for just one little hour
Cute in a stupid ass way

And if I joined the social whirl
Became procurer of young girls
Then I would have my own bordellos
My record would be number one
And I'd sell records by the ton
All sung by many other fellows
My name would then be handsome Jack
And I'd sell boats of opium
Whisky that came from Twickenham
Authentic queers
And phony virgins
If I had banks on every finger
A finger in every country
And every country ruled by me
I'd still know where I'd want to be
Locked up inside my opium den
Surrounded by some china men
I'd sing the song that I sang then
About the time they called me "Jacky"

If I could be for only an hour
If I could be for an hour every day
If I could be for just one little hour
Cute in a stupid ass way

Now, tell me, wouldn't it be nice
That if one day in paradise
I'd sing for all the ladies up there
And they would sing along with me
And we be so happy there to be
Cos' down below is really nowhere
My name would then be Junipher
Then I would know where I was going
And then I would become all knowing
My beard so very long and flowing
If I became deaf, dumb and blind
(was: If I could play deaf, dumb and blind)
Because I pitied all mankind
And broke my heart to make things right
I know that every single night
When my angelic work was through
The angels and the Devil too
Would sing my childhood song to me
About the time they called me "Jacky"

If I could be for only an hour
If I could be for an hour every day
If I could be for just one little hour
Cute in a stupid ass way


Best Of Both Worlds,
That's what you want
All your own way, That's not my way
And I won't share you, I couldn't fare to
It's time for you to choose
Which one you'd rather loose
Could you love me, And forget me
Are you sorry, That you've met me?
What we've been through,
Means nothing to you I can't satisfy you
You want
Best Of Both Worlds
Make your fickle mind up
I won't stay while you enjoy
Best of Both Worlds
I have loved you Since I found you
You belong here,
Just look around you
Keep your true love,
Or take your new love
You must choose between us,
You want Best Of Both Worlds
Make your fickle mind up
I won't stay while you enjoy
Best Of Both Worlds
You've got to choose between us
You just can't have the two of us
Make your fickle mind up
I won't stay while you enjoy
Best of Both Worlds

Here I am back home again
I'm here to rest
All they ask is where I've been
Knowing I've been West.

I'm the family's unknown boy
Golden curls and envied hair
Pretty girls with faces fair
See the shining Black Sheep Boy.

If you love me, let me live in peace.
Please understand,
That the black sheep can wear the golden fleece,
And hold a winning hand.

I'm the family's unknown boy
Golden curls and envied hair
Pretty girls with faces fair
See the shining Black Sheep Boy.

Hello Mr. Big Shot
Say, you're looking smart
I've had a tiring day
I took the kids along to the park

You've become a stranger
Every night with the boys
Got a new suit
That old smile's come back
And I kiss the children good night
And I slip away on the newly waxed floor

I've become a giant
I fill every street
I dwarf the rooftops
I hunchback the moon

Stars dance at my feet
Leave it all behind me
Screaming kids on my knee
And the telly swallowing me
And the neighbor shouting next door
And the subway trembling the roller-skate floor

I seek the buildings blazing with moonlight
In Channing Way
Their very eyes seem to suck you in with their laughter
They seem to say

You're all right now
So stop a while behind our smile
In Channing Way

Oh to die of kisses
Ecstasies and charms
Pavements of poets will write that I died
In nine angel's arms

And they all were smiling
Still seductive as sin in their eyes
The man I had been
No more hard luck stories to wear
Nothing left to give
Why the hell should I care

Ann owns my smile and Mary's my shadow
In Channing Way
And with her cellophane sighs
Celina the candle
Begs me to stay

You're all right now
So stop a while behind our smile
In Channing Way

Naked as sin, an army towel
Covering my belly
Some of us blush, somehow
Knees turning to jelly
Next, next

I was still just a kid
There were a hundred like me
I followed a naked body
A naked body follwed me
next, next

I was still just a kid
When my innocence was lost
In a mobile army whorehouse
Gift from the army, free of cost
Next, next

Me, I really would have liked
A little touch of tenderness
Maybe a word, a smile
An hour of happiness
But, next, next

Oh, it wasn't so tragic
The high heavens did not fall
But how much of that time
I hated being there at all
Next, next Now I always will recall
The brothel truck, the flying flags
The queer lieutenant who slapped
Our asses as if we were fags
Next, next

I swear on the wet head
Of my first case of gonorrhea
It is his ugly voice
That I forever hear
Next, next

That voice that stinks of whiskey
Of corpses and of mud
It is the voice of nations
It is the thick voice of blood
Next, next

And since the each woman
I have taken to bed
Seems to laugh in my arms
To whisper through my head
Next, next

All the naked and the dead
Should hold each other's hands
As they watch me scream at night
In a dream no one understands
Next, next

And when I am not screaming
In a voice grown dry and hollow
I stand on endless naked lines
Of the following and the followed
Next, next

One day I'll cut my legs off
Or burn myself alive
Anything, I'll do anything
To get out of line to survive
Never to be next
Never to be next.

Suffocating eyes and fast hellos and last good-byes
Surround the night of me
Mustache large like smoke from his cigar
Coughs up a joke and laughs a net of sound

Swallowing the pinwheel clowns
Consuming all the women
Like a giant sponge
Snap! The waiters animate
Luxuriate like planets whirling 'round the sun
Collapsing next to me
Shouts don't look sad
Things aren't so bad
They're just more wrong than right
His brandy brimmed voice whispers
Come with me I hold the key
The city's ours tonight

Pays the barmaid, slaps her ass
She shrieks her gold teeth flash
With rapturous delight
Earthquaking the sawdust ground
He grabs my arm and out into the famished night

Now two blazing leaves burning up ground
The tiny waltz of a merry go round
Cascading lights for every heartbeat
Tonight we'll sleep with the girls from the streets

Hurry faster don't look back
His coattails snap his laughter's burning in my ears
I ride upon this giant storm
Through rust-red rooms where shadows breathe from every board

The world is up for auction sales
A thousand lies descend
The women's tear-tracked cheeks
Still we'll dance them on and on
We can't stop now
Not now until we reach the dawn

Quick give us your lips
Give us your thighs
Give us your sad and devouring eyes
Cascading tears for every heartbeat
Tonight we'll sleep with the girls from the streets

Over the rooftop sails Billy
A string tied to his underwear
Through cobbled stone streets a child races
And shouts "Billy, come down from there"

"My mother's calling" his voice whimpers
A string clutched in his tiny hand
Not till I've seen the sky's not lit up
In tears, child try and understand
Don't pull the string, Don't bring me down
Don't make me land

Plastic palace people
Sing silent songs, they dream too long
Their memories just stare
Plastic palace Alice
She steals the cards tomorrow deals
With deafening despair

Hurry, you've got to get in line
Your nose might start to shine
And sweat it out and dance about
The whole eternal life

A harvest of stars surrounds Billy
The night clings to his happy eyes
Asleep in town square beneath a fountain
A child murmurs a weary sigh
My mother weeps, And weaves her hair
With worries please, Come down from there

Plastic palace people
Through fields of clay and granite grey
They play without a sound
Plastic palace Alice
Blows gaping holes to store her fears
Inside her lovers head

Listen, they're laughing in the halls
They rip your face with lies
To buzzing eyes you cry for help
Like gods they bark replies

Over the rooftops burns Billy
Balloon sadly the string descends
Searching its way down through blue submarine air
The polka dot underwear
To meet the trees, In morning square
Just hanging there, Just hanging there

ho cares how cold and grey
The day may be
Wait until dark
And we'll be warm

Our place of love
Is where we face our dreams
Together
Where our fantasies take form

When I can't feel your nearness
In the night
My disappointments disappear

A cheerless day may bring us
Little dreams
That seem to miss their mark
But oh my darling
Wait until dark

A cheerless day may bring us
Little dreams
That seem to miss their mark
But oh my darling
Wait until dark


The girls
Are as fast as a game
Are as bright as a flame
And you're always to blame

The girls
Are as pink as the light
And as dark as the night
And they're always right

The girls
Are as cold as the sphinx
Always dreaming of minks
They drive you to drink

The girls
Are as soft as a sigh
That whispers good-bye
And leaves you to cry

But the dogs
Well, they're only dogs
Just wagging their tails
As they watch it end

Oh, the dogs
Well, they're only dogs
And maybe that's why
They're man's best friend

The girls
Can make you feel cold
Can make you feel old
An antique to be sold

The girls
They play with your heart
They tear you apart
You're never too smart

The girls
They throw you from towers
They'll whip you with flowers
It depends on the hours

The girls
Will treat you like trash
Or let you be brash
It depends on your cash

But the dogs
Don't depend on a thing
They just lick your face
When they see it end

Oh, the dogs
Don't depend on a thing
And maybe that's why
They're man's best friend
...

The girls
You know that they are vain
They will poison your brain
They will drive you insane

The girls
Will laugh at your jokes
How they love the coat on
But it is all a hoax

The girls
Are still making dates
they still making you wait
and they say you are late

The girls
Are yours for a throw
At least you think so
Ah but you will never know

The dogs
Well you know the dogs
They lift up a leg
As they see it end

The dogs
Well you know the dogs
And maybe that's why
They're man's best friend
...

The girls
They're not what they seem
They all have a scheme
They call it a dream

The girls
Are as hot as they please
And you're down on your knees
With the greatest of ease

The girls
Say you're on the right track
Then they take it all back
Tie it up in a sack

The girls
They will give it of course
But they give with such force
That it gives you remorse

But the dogs
They give nothing at all
They just lift a leg
As they watch it end

Oh, the dogs
They give nothing at all
And that's the reason why
They're man's best friend

And yet it's because of the girls
When they've knocked us about
And our tears want to shout
That we kick the dogs out

The windows of the world are covered with rain
Where is the sunshine we once knew
Everybody knows when little children play
They need a sunny day to grow straight and tall
Let the sunshine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
When will those black skies turn to blue
Everybody knows when boys grow into men
They start to wonder when their country will call
Let the sunshine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
What is the whole world coming to
Everybody knows when men can not be friends
Their quarter loves an ends
Some have to die, some have to die
Let the sunshine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
There must be something we can do
Everybody knows whenever rain appears
It's really angel tears
How long must they cry

I've watched her from the river banks
I knew her when she danced with dreams
White doves were there to dress her hair
And so was Madelaine

At night the people's faces danced
Like pearls colliding on the breast
Of fat Marie whose thunder laugh
Was just a thread from crying

Her sailors stained her cobblestones
With wine and piss and death desire
And sometimes blood for Madelaine
Whose laughter was the night

Her girls would lift their dresses high
and breathe the stars and kiss the sky
She'd smother them with whispers then
Embrace them with her sighs

Before the bottle dulled my eyes
And made me so I couldn't stand
I'd overact and play the clown
When Madelaine would cry

And now I watch from riverbanks
I watch it weave it's memories
White doves turned gray and flew away
And so did Madelaine

Come Next Spring
When all the world is new
And fresh
And green
And fair
Then I'll come home
And I'll carry in my heart
Just one prayer
That I'll find room
Still waiting for my arms
We'll meet
We'll kiss
We'll cling
And then once more
Love will blossom as before
Come
Come on next spring

And then once more
Love will blossom as before
Come next
Next spring

Come next spring

It's raining today
and I'm just about to forget the train window girl
That wonderful day we met
She smiles through the smoke from my cigarette
It's raining today
But once there was summer and you
And dark little rooms
And sleep in late afternoons
Those moments descend on my windowpane
I've hung around too long
Listenin' to the old landlady's hard-luck stories
You out of me, me out of you
We go like lovers
To replace the empty space
Repeat our dreams to someone new
It's raining today
And I watch the cellophane streets
No hang-ups for me
'Cause hang-ups need company
The street corner girl's a cold trembling leaf
It's raining today
It's raining today

Hope for me, I hope for you,
We're snowdrops falling through the night.

We'll melt away before we land,
Two teardrops for somebody's hand.

Follow me into just one more Spring.

Copenhagen, you're the end,
Gone and made me a child again.
Warmed my feet beneath cold sheets,
Dyed my hair with your sunny streets.

Children aren't afraid to love
And laugh when life amuses them.

And our love is an antique song
For children's carousels

Voices from a photograph
Laugh from your wall
Scream through your dreams
Wake up Rosemary and wipe your teary eyes

Rise and cross the cold bare floor
And watch the moon through frosted glass
Damn that photograph
I'll have to take it down

She hears the boats as they move down the river
She sees a dog straining hard on his leash to get away
She hears the clock and it strikes like a hammer
Pounding the nails one day further in the coffin of her
youth

Evenings with your mother's friends
Pregnant eyes, sagging chins
Swollen fingertips
Pour antique cups of tea

Who are you and where you been?
Suspended in a weightless wind
Watching trains go by
From platforms in the rain

Look at the photograph
Dream back last summer
Dream back the lips
Of that traveling salesman, Mr. Jim

He smelled of miracles
With stained glass whispers
You loved his laughter
You tremble beneath him once again

That's what I want
A new shot at life
But my coat's too thin
My feet won't fly

And I watch the wind and I see another dream blowin' by

She stands all alone
You can hear her hum softly
From her fire escape in the sky
She fills the bags 'neath her eyes
With the moonbeams
And cries 'cause the world's passed her by

Didn't time sound sweet yesterday?
In a world filled with friends
You lose your way

She's a haunted house
And her windows are broken
And the sad young man's gone away
Her bathrobe's torn
And tears smudge her lipstick
And the neighbors just whisper all day

Didn't time sounds sweet yesterday?
In a world filled with friends
You lose your way

We came through
We came riding through like warriors from afar
Our black horses danced upon the graves of yesterday's desires
Haunted by our visions framed in fire
I greet you, for you still believe in what's behind the door
You've seen the children freeze upon their knees
And praying to the wind
To send their grey madonnas back again
Fire the guns, and salute the men who died for freedom's sake
And we'll weep tonight, but we won't lie awake
Gazing up at statues dressed in stars
We won't dream, for they don't come true for us
Not anymore
They've run afar to hide in caves
With haggard burning eyes
Their icy voices tear our hearts like knives

We came through
Like the Gothic monsters perched on Notre Dame
We observe the naked souls of gutters pouring forth mankind
Smothered in an avalanche of time
And we're giants as we watch our kings and countries raise their shields
And Guevara dies encased in his ideals
And as Luther King's predictions fade from view
We came through

There's a butterfly circling the beach
Searching the rocks where you are
He chooses your hair, and that's where he belongs
For he's lost like a star
Head down, reluctant and warm
You give your thoughts to the sea
Dark rivers your eyes belong to no-one
Like a star
Like a butterfly

They spoke transparent phrases to looking glass women
And they took the detours that scattered the way
They departed from summer like two ragged soldiers
Dragging their heels through their fantasies

There were meals in the missions for two frozen statues
And long draughty sermons devouring their knees
Sometimes passions in winter turn to cold soundless moments
That teared in the eyes of their fantasies

There were nights on park benches, stale bread for the pigeons
Good mornings to faces who just turned away
And on one road confusion, the other desire
So they took to the road of their fantasies

One would speak of a lake where he used to go swimming
The other had no memories left for his mind
With their arms round each other the two ragged soldiers
Laughed through a war that they couldn't see

Laughed for a world filled with fantasy

See the dwarves and see the giants
Which one would you choose to be?
And if you can't get that together
Here's the answer, here's the key

You can freeze like a 30 Century Man
Like a 30 Century Man
I'll save my bread and take it with me

'Til a hundred years or so
Shame you won't be there to see me
Shakin' hands with Charles De Gaulle

Play it cool and Saranwrap all you can
Be a 30 Century Man

You can freeze like a 30 Century Man
Like a 30 Century Man
Like a 30 Century Man


You're like a winter night
Your thoughts are frozen
You kiss your lovers
In the snow

Too many icy tears
Glisten for someone

You watch the leaves
As they shiver your loneliness
Your eyes are lanterns
Growing dim

I hum inside
Like the meadows in summer

But I'll never light them up
Again

Two weeks since you've gone
And I feel like the tramp
Picking dustbins in the alley.
He looks up as I pass
Clutching rags from a city's restless night

I could read all my sadness
In faces I knew
Down at Kelly's bar last Friday
And I haven't been back since I mistook
Somebody for a friend

And if I walk these streets long enough
Will you happen to me again?
With whom are you sharing
The sweet taste of summer?
My memories pursue you
Like puddles of rain
The river inside me still flow
To the sea of your hands

And if I close my eyes for a while
Will you happen to me again?

Sons of the thief, sons of the saint
Who is the child with no complaint
Sons of the great or sons unknown
All were children like your own
The same sweet smiles, the same sad tears
The cries at night, the nightmare fears
Sons of the great or sons unknown
All were children like your own...

So long ago: long, long, ago...

But sons of tycoons or sons of the farms
All of the children ran from your arms
Through fields of gold, through fields of ruin
All of the children vanished too soon
In tow'ring waves, in walls of flesh
Among dying birds trembling with death
Sons of tycoons or sons of the farms
All of the children ran from your arms...

So long ago: long, long, ago...

But sons of your sons or sons passing by
Children we lost in lullabies
Sons of true love or sons of regret
All of the sons you cannot forget
Some built the roads, some wrote the poems
Some went to war, some never came home
Sons of your sons or sons passing by
Children we lost in lullabies...

So long ago: long, long, ago

But, sons of the theif, sons of the saint
Who is the child with no complaint
Sons of the great or sons unknown
All were children like your own
The same sweet smiles, the same sad tears
The cries at night, the nightmare fears
Sons of the great or sons unknown
All were children like your own...

Oh I can see them now
Clutching a hankerchief
And blowing me a kiss
Discreetly asking how
How came he died so young
Or was he very old
Is the body still warm
Or is it already cold
All doors are open wide
They grope around inside
At my desk my drawers my trunk
There's nothing left to hide
Some love letters are there
And an old photograph
They've laid my poor soul bare
And now all they do is laugh

Oh I can see them all
So formal and so stiff
Like a sergeant at arms
At a policeman's ball
And everybody's pushing
To be the first in line
Their hearts upon their sleeves
Like a ten cent valentine
The old women are there
Too old to give a damn
They've brought along the kids
Who don't know who I am
They're thinking about the price of my funeral bouquet
What they're thinking isn't nice
For now they'll have to pay

Oh I see all of you
All of my phoney friends
Who can't wait for it ends
Who can't wait till it's through
Oh I see all of you
You've been laughing all these years
Now all that you have left
Are a few crocodile tears
Ah you don't even know
That you're entering your hell
As you leave my cemetary
You think you're doing well
With that one who's at your side
You're as proud as you can be
Ah she's going to make you cry
But not the way you cried for me

Oh I can see me now
So cold and so alone
As the flowers slowly die
In my field of little bones
Oh I can see me now
I can see me at the end
Of this voyage that I/m on
Without a love without a friend
Now all this that I see
Is not what I deserve
They really have a nerve
To say these things to me
No girls just bread and water
And your money you must save
For there'll be nothing left for us
When you're dead and in your grave

If you go away
On this summer day
Then you might as well
Take the sun away
All the birds that flew
In the summer sky
When our love was new
And our hearts were high
And the day was young
And the night was long
And the moon stood still
For the night bird's song

If you go away

But if you stay
I'll make you a day
Like no day has been
Or will be again
We'll sail the sun
We'll ride on the rain
And talk to the trees
And worship the wind

Then if you go
I'll understand
Leave me just enough love
To fill up my hand

If you go away
As I know you will
You must tell the world
To stop turning, turning
'til you return again
If you ever do
For what good is love
Without loving you?
Can I tell you now
As you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly
'til the next hello

But if you stay
I'll make you a night
Like no night has been
Or will be again
I'll sail on your smile
I'll glide on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes
That I love so much

But if you go
I won't cry
Though the good is gone
From the word goodbye

If you go away
As I know you must
There'll be nothing left
In this world to trust
Just an empty room
Full of empty space
Like the empty look
I see on your face
And I'd have been the shadow
Of your shadow
If it might have kept me
By your side

Anybody seen a knight pass this way
I saw him playing chess with Death yesterday
His crusade was a search for God and they say
It's been a long way to carry on

Anybody hear of plague in this town
The town I've left behind was burned to the ground
A young girl on a stake her face framed in flames cried
I'm not a witch God knows my name

The knight he watched with fear
He needed to know
He ran where he might feel God's breath
And in the misty church
He knelt to confess
The face within the booth was Mr. Death

My life's a vain pursuit of meaningless smiles
Why can't God touch me with a sign
Perhaps there's no one there answered the booth
And Death hid within his cloak and smiled

This morning I played chess with Death said the knight
We played that he might grant me time
My bishop and my knight will shatter his flanks
And still I might feel God's heart in mine

And through confession's grille Death's laughter was heard
The knight cried No you've cheated me!
But still I'll find a way
We'll meet once again and once again
Continue to play

They met within the woods the knight his squire and friends
And Death said now the game shall end
The final move was made
The knight hung his head
And said you've won I've nothing left to play

The minstrel filled with visions sang to his love
To look against the stormy sky
The knight his squire and friends
Their hands held as one
Solemnly danced toward the dawn

His hourglass in his hand his scythe by his side
The master Death he leads them on
The rain will wash away the tears from their faces
And as the thunder cracked they were gone

Wasn't it a good year
Wasn't filled with talking
It still moves through my heart
From time to time
City after city
Granite gray as morning
Heroes died in subways left behind
far behind like our love

You're on your own again
And you're your best again
That's what you tell yourself
I see it all the way
as far as anyone can see
Except when it began
I was so happy I didn't feel like me


As the morning turned my way
See birds flying through this hazy face
And I came back here to replace your place in my life

And didn't you know that I'm not the world's strongest man
When it comes to you and your world I'm lost
Can't you see the towers of mine they could shine like a dime
Take me back again to your warm design

And again again again
Longing for belongings here again
And I need your love you know I can't pretend anymore

And didn't you know that I'm not the world's strongest man
When it comes to you and your world I'm lost
Can't you see the towers of mine they could shine like a dime
Take me back again to your warm design

The Angels of Ashes
Will give back your passions
Again and again

Their light shafts
Will reach through the darkness
And touch you my friend

They'll fly in a mind dance
And blind you with wings
Wrapped in flame

If you're down to an echo
They just might remember
Your name

In the unbroken darkness
Where emptiness empties
Alone

There's no starting or stopping
Where there is no right or
No wrong

Well that's all right for some
Who can hang the absurd
On their wall

If your blind hands can't grope
Through these measureless waters
You'll fall

You've been following patterns
And fleeting sensations
Too long

And the fullness that fills up
The pulse of durations
Is gone

Let the great constellation
Of flickering ashes
Be heard

Let them burn with a fire
All it takes to confess
Is a word, just a word

I can recommend angels
I've watched as they've made a man strong
Oh so strong

If your humbleness shows
Then I'm sure that they'll take you
Along

You can tell them who sent you
It might help to get you
Above

You can say that he laughed
And he walked like St. Francis
With love

You'll lose your way
A boy child rides upon your back
Take him away
Through mirrors dark and blessed with cracks
Through forgotten courtyards
Where you used to search for youth
Old gets a new life
Reach out you can touch it's true
He's not a shadow of shadows
Like you, you see
Hearts hold on holding
If you stay one, you'll stay free

Go seek the lady
Who will give, not take away
Naked with stillness
On the edge of dawn she stays
Night starts to empty
That's when her song begins
She'll make you happy
She'll take you deep within
Window lights for wanderers
Hide hard in your swollen eyes
Echoes of laughter
Hide in the cities thighs

Love catch these fragments
Swirling through the winds of night
What can it cost
To give a boy child back his sight
Extensions through dimensions
Leave you feeling cold and lame
Boy child mustn't tremble
'cos he came without a name

He's a hero of the war
All the neighborhood is talkin' 'bout your son
Mrs. Reiley get his medals
Hand them 'round to everyone
Show his gun to all the children in the street
It's too bad he can't shake hands or move his feet

He's a hero of the war
You can see his picture in the local news
Mrs. Reiley seems the girl next door is nowhere to be found
Once you couldn't keep that boy from hangin' 'round
Never mind dear, you're with your mum once more

He's a hero of the war
Like his dad he gave his life the war before
It was tragic how you almost died of pain when he was born
With no husband there beside you through it all
Ring the bell if you get hungry or you fall

You're a hero of the war
Why those teardrops on your cheek? it's so absurd
Feelin' empty it's the emptiness of heroes like your son
And what made him leave his mother for a gun
Driven forward driven back and nothing more

He's a hero of the war

I seen a hand, I seen a vision
It was reaching through the clouds, To risk a dream

A shadow crossed the sky
And it crushed into the ground, Just like a beast

The old man's back again
The old man's back again

I seen a woman, standing in the snow
She was silent as she watched them take her man

Teardrops burned her cheeks
for she thought she'd heard, The shadow had left this land

The old man's back again
The old man's back again

The crowds just gathered, their faces turned away
And they queue all day like dragons of disgust

All the women whispering
Wondering just what these young hot-heads want of us
And entres vie he cries

with eyes that ring like chimes
His anti-worlds go spinning through his head
He burns them in his dreams
for half awake they may as well be dead

The old man's back again
I see he's back again

I see a soldier, He's standing in the rain
For him there's no old man to walk behind

Devoured by his pain
bewildered by the faces who pass him by

He'd like another name the one he's got's a curse
These people cried
Why can't they understand
His mother called him Ivan then she died

The old man's back again
The old man's back again
I can see him back again

It's your bicycle bells and your Rembrandt swells
Your children alive and still breathing
And your look of loss when you're coming across
Makes me feel like a thief when you're bleeding

Duchess Duchess
Light up your candles for me
Duchess Duchess
Put all your love back in me
I come listening I touch touching

With the Persian sea running through your veins
You shed your names with the seasons
Still they all return with the last remains
And they lay them before you like reasons

With your shimmering dress it says no it says yes
It says I've nothing left for conceiving
Its your shiftless flesh and your old girl's grace
Its your young girl's face that I'm breathing

Duchess Duchess
Light up your candles for me
Duchess Duchess Duchess
Put all the love back in me

I am lying she is crying

It's the signs as we see them
There's no thresholds at all
There's no vows to be broken
As we rise, or we fall
There's no noise high above us
As the moon turns in space
Just the face of a lady
Who we loved for her grace

Get behind me, Get behind me
Won't you bend my ear again
I really need a friend
Get behind me, Get behind me
Remind me to remind me
Not to go back there again

When the threads of dark moments
Start to tremble with sound
And an almost formed whisper dies
The boundaries surround
We keep reaching beyond us
Through the shape shifting clouds
Why ain't I like you brother,
So electric, so proud

Get behind me, Get behind me
Won't you bend my ear again
I really need a friend
Get behind me, Get behind me
Remind me to remind me
Not to go back there again

Set us free of this feeling
So we'll be once again
So we won't feel the gravity of time
And the face in the faces
Of the loves we move through
Reappears in original design

Get behind me, Get behind me
Won't you bend my ear again
I really need a friend
Get behind me, Get behind me
Remind me to remind me
Not to go back there again

I've come from far from chains,
From metal and stone,
From makeshift designs,
And seeking a star

To grab for the truth,
To keep myself warm,
I turn and it's gone,
You smile and it's born.

The rhymes of a woman's,
A river that never ends
The Rhymes of Dimension,
Surrounds us with fire and friends,
And roaring through darkness,
The Night children fly,
I still hear them singing the rhymes of goodbye

There's nothing within,
but within says a voice,
That's still my Empire,
And I've got a choice

Its healers of death,
It's still got a fire,
And I keep it burning,
With hands of desire

The bells of our senses,
Can cost us our pride,
Can toll out the boundaries,
That level our lives

Can slash like the sunlight,
Through shadows and cracks,
Our nakedness calling,
Our nakedness back

The rhyme of our passions,
Find beauty in loving love,
The rhyme of our madness,
Burn cities and push'n'shoves,
And roaring through darkness,
The Night children fly,
I still hear them singing the rhymes of goodbye

It's on days like these
When your brother falls
You can read it all in the Times
How a moving car
Stole a movie star
Little Things that keep us together
While the war's going on
It's on days like these
When your childhood cries
And you see it all on the news
Little children starve
Growing tired of born
Little things that keep us all close and warm
While the war's going on
Find a place you can hide
And take what you can
The time will arrive
When you need a friend
Stop looking at us
We're waving good-bye
There's a man
Shouting he's with me
When that morning comes
I can't wait to see
Just how high his eagle
On color screens
Is gonna fly
Going to fly
It's on nights like these
That your neighbor dies
'Cos he put a gun to his head
He was so alone
He had nothing left
Little things that call for a drink
That bury a soldier's death
It's on days like these
When your sister cries
And your brother falls from your hands
Jumbo jets can die
Killing 81
Little things that help us get by the why
Why the war's going on
Why the war's going on
Why the war is going on
why the war is going on
why the war's going on
why the war's going on

As old Joe sat a dyin'
The baby down the hall was cryin'
Somebody had a party goin' on
The fat boy you told tales to
Moved away the other day
To think with no goodbye
He could have gone
A postcard from Sun City
Was found layin' by your side
A kind of desert place
Where old folks dry away
You gazed out through the window
At the wonders of the sky
As if it were the first time every day

There ain't no-one left alive to call me Joe
You used to say
No-one left alive
To call me Joe.

You've been beyond the boundaries
Understood it all
And thought of nothing
The ultimate was simple to your eyes
Just watch the world make madness
As the youth cried their replies
An old man knows far better than to try.
They say towards the end
You hardly left your shabby room
Where once you loved to go
Walkin'
Thru' the day
Sit back and watch a spider
Weave your window
'Cross the moon
And meals on wheels
Laughed kindly
When you'd say

There ain't no-one left alive to call me Joe
To call me Joe
No-one left alive to call me Joe.

You always said I wouldn't stay
I guess you saw the way
Before it all began
I've always been a changin' train
And when you think on this
You might forgive me then

Thanks for Chicago Mr James
And all the shiny suits
And all the shining names
The things a country boy can't grace
Without the look of shame
Upon a city face
And you needed more
Than the smile I wore

You picked me up on my way down
The dusty one horse town
I won't forget the jail
The mayor's wife and Cadillac
The sheriff on my back
'Til you put up the bail

Thanks for Chicago Mr James
You got a lot of grace
But you're an empty place
The dawn falls hard upon my face
I'll move as I began
Thru' fields without a plan

Thanks for Chicago Mr James
That world of grey and gold
That watched you growing old
The things I never saw I see
To think that I'm still free
And I'm not feeling cold

Long about now
He's heading home
Back from the rain
Burned to the ground

His ashes will rise black butterflies
Tapping at my window pane

He'll want to rest within my design
All the way to the end
Lighting my skies all up inside again

Dimming Summer

Long about now
He's headin' home
Drowning the games
That steel a man

Long about now
He'll shrug and sigh and need me again

Moon breathin' in thru' my window
Curtains are sighing dust of the day
Still I'm not alone like all my neighbours say

Time Operator
Take the time to take the time
To come over here
We got so much in common
Seems it's hard for us to sleep
With all the razzle dazzle in the street

The man come to shut off my water
The man come to shut down my lights yesterday
I'm not one to moan
I made the bill for the telephone

Now I wouldn't care if you're ugly
'Cos here with the lights out I couldn't see
You just picture Paul Newman
And girl he looks a lot like me

Time Operator
Take the time to take the time
To come over here
We got so much in common
Seems it's hard for us to sleep
With all the razzle dazzle in the street

Whatever happened to Jean the machine
She used to live down the hall from me
And all of the boys in the band
Miss her so bad now
Ain't it pitiful
She made her way from Hungary
A refugee with a voice like Callas
But somehow she couldn't get on
So she took it off
At the, the local Palace

Jean come back (Why'd you go now)
Jean come back (Things are slow now)
Jean come back

My landlady said Jean's a commie spy
And each time I asked for the reason why
My landlady said it's a front
She bumps and grinds codes
To an audience of immigrants
It blows my mind when I think of Jean
Every night with a new routine
'Cos I play drums in the band
She used me as part
Of her dirty commie plan

Jean come back (we forgive you)
Jean come back (boy scouts honour)
Jean come back (Spiro Agnew)
Jean come back (To the Bolshoi)
Jean come back (To your homeland)
Jean come back (bring the microfilm)

Andrea turn to me and hear what I'm sayin'
And why must you always be kneelin' and prayin'
Though hard as I run
I can't overcome
The things that this city has taken
Cowbells shakin'

Go back to our village awailin' and weepin'
And tell your fat momma the life we've been keepin'
Your head waiter brother won't give me a job
And I've walked these streets till I'm breakin'
Cowbells shakin'

Andrea speak up can't you hear what I'm sayin'
And why must you always be kneelin' and prayin'

Here on the outskirts of life
It's a world with the voice of a caretaker's wife
I'm leaving tomorrow don't let it bring you down
Stick around and around and around and around.

'Til the band comes in
And the clouds begin to open
'Til the band comes in
And we hear them all as one
I'll be back again
If you promise that you'll write me
'Til the band comes rollin' in.

Keep your friends
With their windows so high
Keep your city
With children that shine through it's eye
If you need me to move thru'
You know where I'm found
Still alive with my subhuman sound to the ground.

'Til the band comes in
And the clouds begin to open
'Til the band comes in
And we hear them all as one
I'll be back again
If you promise that you'll write me
'Til the band comes rollin' in.

The times we sat and sang of all the hidden things we knew
Did they ever come up true
Can't remember, can't remember
And it's the time to sing a song
Across the emptiness between us
And remember.

Everything still
Everything silent
As after the rain

We lie here listening
To night close down

Stare like a child
Wait for the signs to decide
Once again

Just when they looked here
To stay
We're to leave
Our world arraign
It really isn't fair

Outside they sing
The war is over
Raise your blinds
The war is over
Tell your deepest dark
Goodbye

A distant waltz
Turns in the head
Of an old lady's night
Waiting hands unfold
Within the dark

Lighting her lamp
Seeing Prince Albert
Recalling the sight
They waltz again through the park
Floorboards creak
Beneath the moon
The room below just sighs

Outside they sing
The war is over
Raise your blinds
The war is over
Let me get some sleep
Tonight

Everything still
Everything silent
As after the rain

Still we are after
The rain

You were the sunshine, baby
Whenever you smiled
But I call you Stormy today

All of a sudden
That ole rain's fallin' down
And my world is cloudy and gray
You've gone away

Oh Stormy,
Stormy, Stormy, Stormy
Bring back that sunny day

Yesterday's love
Was like a warm summer breeze
But, just like the weather you changed
Now things are dreary, baby
And it's windy and cold
And I stand alone in the rain
And I'm callin' your name

Yeah Stormy,
Stormy, Stormy, Stormy
Bring back that sunny day

Oh, my storm
Come on back and storm
Come on back and bring back that sun again

I need you Stormy, Stormy, Stormy
Stormy
Bring it back, bring that sunny day, bring that sunny day
Bring that sunny day

Once we strolled the hills of yesterday
We are young in those hills far away
Through the good times and bad
My heart is very glad
That you and I once shared a dream so long ago

Autumn ends, a willow bends with snow
But wherever you are I must go
Take me back once again to the hills of yesterday
Where you first stole my heart away

Through the good times and bad
My heart is very glad
That you and I once shared a dream so long ago

Autumn ends, a willow bends with snow
But wherever you are I must go
Take me back once again to the hills of yesterday
Where you first stole my heart away

Reuben James, in my song you live again
And the phrases that I rhyme
Are just footsteps out of time
From the time when I first knew you Reuben James

Reuben James all the folks around Madison County
Cursed your name
Just a no-account share-croppin' colored man
Who would steal anything he can
And they always laid the blame on Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind
The faded shirt, the weathered brow
The calloused hand upon the plough
I loved you then and I love you now Reuben James

Flora Gray, the gossip of Madison County died with a child
And although your skin was black
It was you that didn't turn your back
On a hungry white child with no name, Reuben James

Reuben James, with your mind on my soul
And the Bible in your right hand
You said turn the other cheek
A better world is a-waiting for the meek
In my head those words remain from Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind
The faded shirt, the weathered brow
The calloused hand upon the plough
I loved you then and I love you now Reuben James

Reuben James one dark cloudy day
They brought you from the fields
And to your lonely pine box came
Just a preacher, me and the rain
To sing one last refrain for Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind
The faded shirt, the weathered brow
The calloused hand upon the plough
I loved you then and I love you now Reuben James

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share
Would always be
There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
And make us realize our night is over

When you walk away from me
There is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun
That rises over the land
I watch you walk away
Somehow I have to let you go
Cause it's over

If you knew just how I really feel
You might return and yet
There are so many times
That people have to love and then forget
Oh there might have been a way somehow
I have to force myself to say
It's over

So I turn my back,
Turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence
Trying not to think at all
I set my feet before me
Walk the silent street before me
Now it's over

If time were not a moving thing
And I could make you stay
This hour of love we share
Would always be
There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
And make us realize our night is over

It's over

This way Mary, come Mary
Share the world with me
Make this moment our moment
And our memories

This way Mary, come Mary
Let me warm your heart
Take this love I bring you
And then let forever start

This way Mary, come Mary
While the sun is high
Make this summer the summer
That refuse to die

This way Mary, run Mary
Our love had to be
So take my hand
And walk this way with me

This way Mary, come Mary
Our love has to be
So take my hand
And walk this way with me

Speak softly love, and hold me warm against your heart
I feel your words, the tender trembling moments start
We're in a world, our very own
Sharing a love that only few have ever known

Wine coloured days, warmed by the sun
Deep velvet nights, when we are one

Speak softly love, so no-one hears us but the sky
The vows of love we make will live until we die
My life is yours and all because
You came into my world with love
So softly love

Wine coloured days, warmed by the sun
Deep velvet nights, when we are one

Speak softly love, so no-one hears us but the sky
The vows of love we make will live until we die
My life is yours and all because
You came into my world with love
So softly
Love...

Wearin' my high boots
Got all my wordlies here in a sack
Looking for something
Knowing that it ain't here where I'm at

I'm comin' back - I'm comin'
Ride by thumbin'
Get by bummin', I'm on my way

"Friend, have you seen Glory Road?
Say friend, I've got a heavy load
And I know Glory Road's waiting for me"

Caught me a pick-up down from Seattle to L.A.
Seems like those folks go chasin' a new star every day
Ain't gonna stay in Nevada - through Wyoming
Colorado - I'm on my way

"Friend, have you seen Glory Road?
Say friend, I've got a heavy load
And I know Glory Road's waiting for me"

It's so many autumns
Which way to go? -
Louisiana, New York City
They won't give the answer
They ask of me:

"Friend, have you seen Glory Road?
Say friend, I've got a heavy load
And I know Glory Road's waiting for me"

Rest my load, now I know
Glory Road won't set me free

The snow was on the hill
The fields were soft and white
We touched and time stood still
On that hill, on that night

Your glances said 'begin'
Begin this strange affair
Your glances begged 'begin'
And we loved sweetly there

Time will pass, memories fade
Of a bold bizarre charade
Of a kiss in the night
Out of time, and sight

The snow was on the hill
The fields were soft and white
We touched and time stood still
On that hill
On that night...

The summer smiles, the summer knows
And unashamed, she sheds her clothes
The summer smoothes the restless sky
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie

The summer knows, the summer's wise
She sees the doubts within your eyes
And so she takes her summertime
Tells the moon to wait, and the sun to linger
Twists the world 'round her summer finger

As you see
The wonder of it all
And if you've learned your lesson well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress
It's time to dress for fall

And if you've learned your lesson well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress
It's time to dress
For fall


Father - yes, I am a prisoner
Fear not, to relate my crime
The crime is loving the forsaken
Only silence is shame

Blessed are the persecuted
And blessed are the pure in heart
Blessed are the merciful
Blessed are the ones who mourn

"Give to me your tired and your poor
Your huddled masses, yearning to be free
The wretched refuge of your teeming shore
Send these, the homeless"
- send this task to me

And now I'll tell you
What's against us
And aught that's lived for centuries
Go through the years
And you will find
What's blackened all
Of the history

Father, yes I am a prisoner
Only silence is...
Shame

Tomorrow is a face in the crowd
A leaf in the wind
A bend in the road
We're travelling

Tomorrow is a sky filled with dreams
A gift from the moon
A sea we have yet to sail
But must very soon

Will we be there together?
We should be there together
I've done moving alone
Through the miles of miles of yesterday

We're each of us a face in the crowd
Now you and I can share all there is between 'hello' and
'goodbye'

Together we can try
Together
We can
Try...

I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night
Alive as you or me
Says I: "But Joe, you're ten years dead"
"I never died", said he
"I never died", said he

"The copper bosses killed you, Joe
They shot you Joe", said I
"Takes more than guns to kill a man"
Says Joe: "I did not die"
Says Joe: "I did not die"

Standing there as big as life
And a-smiling with his eyes
Says Joe: "What they can never kill
Went on to organize
Went on to organize."

"From San Diego up to Maine,
In every mine an' mill
Where working men defend their rights,"
It say: "You'll find Joe Hill
It's there you'll find Joe Hill
It's there you'll find Joe
Joe Hill, Joe Hill"

Love is storm and wind, then tide
All the tears your heart can hold
But I look back after loss of love
And find the days were gone

I see only shattered skies
Not a ray of light to find
But I look back after loss of love
And sunlight blinds my mind

Songs were sung with words as young as May
But in the mist of summer, winter came
A chill blew out the flame

Now the words have haunted suns
Ring as clear as they did then
Still I look back after loss of love
And learn to love again

Songs were sung with words as young as May
But in the mist of summer, winter came
A chill blew out the flame

Now the words have haunted suns
Ring as clear as they did then
Still I look back after loss of love
And learn to love
Again...

When you're standing alone
With the mountain and the ski
When the arms of the world open wide
Well, the trick is that plain as a falling rain
And you're sure as the time and the tide

You see, we're all His children, His next of kin-
That's the way it began
No matter were you're going, or where you been-
You are the family of Man

When you walk down a road
And the sun is on your side
With the sweet river breathes on your face
When you don't hear a sound, as you look around
Everything are to fall into place

You see, we're all His children, His next of kin-
That's the way it began
No matter where you're going, or where you been-
You're part of the family of Man

You see, we're all His children, His next of kin-
That's the way it began
No matter where you're going, or where you been-
You're part of the family of Man

Come Saturday Morning
I'm going away with my friend
Will Saturday spend more than half of the day?

Just I and my friend
We'll wander for miles
In our Saturday smiles
And then we'll move on
But we will remember
Long after Saturday's gone

Come Saturday morning
I'm going away with my friend
We'll wander for miles
In our Saturday smiles

Just I and my friend
Dressed up in our rings
And our Saturday things
And then we'll move on
But we will remember
Long after Saturday's gone

Easy come, easy go
That's the way if love must have its stay
Then ours, it came-
Let it go

No remorse, no regret
We should part exactly as we met
Just easy come, easy go

We never dreamt of romantic dangers
Now that it ends- let's be friends
And not two strangers

Easy come, easy go
Here we are, so darling: au revoir
Easy come, easy go

Throw off those gimmicks to the boys
Let them send it all up in the air
There is crouching and wailing on stone down here
We must freeze off this ratmosphere
Scraping out noise across nite wires
Runs - for the distant cities
There is never a lock in the fall down here
As the big full pours away

In the shutout
In the shutout
How will we know the great doll?

Something attacked the earth last nite
With a kick that man habit - eye
Cut the sleep tight boys who dreamed and dreamed
Of a city like the sky
There were faces bobbing in the heat
For some rising from her zone
Moving, hitting, holding on
For the promise to carry us home

In the shutout
In the shutout
Never a lock in the fall
In the shutout
In the shutout
How will we know the great doll?

Sunfighters locked in right angle rooms
Watch their lovers sleep face down in the yellow lite
Keep the balance on a back curve
'till the war with the nite is over

The gods are gone, the air is thick
You cannot risk the fat fat mama kick

Armed angels walk the city Iites
Wait inside their master corpses peeled raw, betrayed
And fade and fade
As the noise goes over and over

The gods are gone, the searchlites lick
You cannot risk the fat fat mama kick

DEAF-DUMB-BLIND
DEAF-DUMB-BLIND
DEAF-DUMB-BLIND
DEAF-DUMB-BLIND

There's no hold
The moving has come through
The danger brushing you
Turns its face into the heat
And runs the tunnels
It's so cold
The dark dug up by dogs
The stitches torn and broke
The raw meat fist you choke
Has hit the bloodlite

Glass traps open and close on nite flights
Broken necks, featherweights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
Only one promise, only one way to fall

Glass traps open and close on nite flights
Broken necks, featherweights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
Only one promise, only one way to fall

On the nite flights, on the nite flights
On the nite flights, only one way to fall
On the nite flights, on the nite flights
On the nite flights, only one way to fall

Baby, it's slow
When lights go low
There's no help, no
Baby, it's slow
When lights go low
There's no help, no

He's drilling through the Spiritus Sanctus tonight
Through the dark hip falls
Screaming, "Oh, you mambos
Kill me and kill me and kill me"
If I jerk the handle
You'll die in your dreams
If I jerk the handle, jerk the handle
You'll thrill me and thrill me and thrill me

Baby, it's slow
When lights go low
There's no help, no

This is how you disappear
out between midnight,

called up under valleys
of torches and stars.

Foot, knee, shaggy belly, face
famous hindlegs,

as one of their own
you graze with them.

Cro-magnon herders
will stand in the wind,
sweeping tails shining,
and scaled to begin,

SHUTTING DOWN HERE
SHUTTING DOWN HERE –

– to where necks
leave the air
unpossesed

and giant heads lock
constellations.

A last grain of dust
lands in the darkness
on tongues laid bare,

and turning to chalk.

Shutting down here.

Freezing in red,
bent over his ice skin,
The insomniac gnaws
in the On-Offs;

he is glazed
in the hooves
all round.

It is losing its shape.
Losing its shape,
as the heat
in your hands
carve the muscle
away.

And he grins
from a break
in a backflash.

Delivers it up
on a break
in a backflash.

Motionless brands
burn into a hipframe
As a saviour
loads sightlines
backlit by fires,

on the ridges
of the highest
breeder

The windows are ringing
shaking Night-nites for angels
rattling throats up and down on a beam.

Cooling the hearts
cooling the plasma
keeping ice junkies packed hard on a seam

The other side of a prowler
the dead still search the living.

At least there we did not not fail.

Coming to in the overcast
tracks are still flowing.

At least there he does not wail.

Psalms of your hands
sung into the lateness
move a circuit on the white
and he can't feel a thing.

Gone always alone to all you are never
he climbs into your mouth
when the windows ring.

The windows are ringing
shaking dead men for angels
Hissing brains boiling up
press't to the bone

uncoils the wire whole night long
bumping out thru the eye in knots.

Sweet hot numbers
sweet hots
bumping out thru the eye
on a wire of knots.

Sweet hot numbers
sweet hots
bumping out thru the eye
on a wire of knots.

Psalms of your hands
sung into the lateness
move a circuit on the white
and he can't feel a thing.

Gone always alone to all you are never
he climbs into your mouth
when the windows ring.

Delayed in the headlong
Resembled to breaking-point
I swear you never slept at night
when the growing is slow.

After me I'm no man's son
run out of recognize.

The blood of our
split back without his prisoner
the distance rigged in his eyes

Rock of cast-offs
bury me
hide my soul
and sink us free.

Rock of cast offs
bury me
hide my soul
and pray us free.

From the host of late-comers
a miracle enters the streets
shining with rain
he is shaking to wash
the murder away.

The shadow of the son
made the son a shadow

it's never night when I die.

That desert clouds under
and so Lord lightens
sleepers wait there
with wounds in their sides.

In the strength of the crime
you sing like a stranger
and your failure fulfills
your most secret defeat.

After me I'm no man's son
run out of recognize.

A life of it's own
lays down the horizon
the distance rigged in it's eyes

Rock of cast-offs
bury me
hide my soul
and sink us free.

Rock of cast offs
bury me
hide my soul
and pray us free.

In the time of an exile
from the jails of another
where soundings are taken
raw to his eyes.

I have walked the way from him
down to splintering bone ashes
with your voice shining sea
in his fractures and skys.

There are no voices here.

There are only confessions.
keeping him hidden
weighed out of his name

We have entered deserted.

He has gazed from my windows
as if all that replaced us
could still end in me.

For the first time unwoken
I am returned.

For the first time unwoken
I am returned.

He arrives from a place
with a face of fast sun.

Arrives from a space
his refuge overrun.

She will fold him away in his
badly changed hand.

Fold him away far behind
where I am.

For the first time forgetting
I am returned.

As if all that replaced us ends it again
as if all that replaced us ends.

It's a starving reflection
if he dies in the night
listening to the increase.

It cuts out your likeness
in blood circulations
suspended beneath a release.

A low volume force feed
lower than pity
slips across under the heart
and your hostage rewinding
from every eclipse
rolls in the voltage
run-off rain on his lips.

We chew up the blackness
to some high sleep
travel a faster silence.

One to go long again
in the going –
– gone again.

Full stare passages
striking less face;
outside on the move
a shattered heart pace
greases the fade;
sinking the blood back
breaking to where loaded icons wade.

Eyesides catch far awake
in a cols sanctuary.

Pain sonics eternities
all through themoves.

A first communication
tears loose undelivered
and swims unassigned
in your dimmed latitudes.

And the heat from the shore
melts down to recieve us;
floodlit foreheads
howled open and so nearly blessed
as they soften round dog-joys
of unfinished strangers
rubbed out on a point
afterburning

Say it got late
on that one.
That life-giver one.
Hanging weightless from the wound
in a half-light.

Taken up I could hold him
when all falls away.
Prayed into each other
you stood in the air

And the ceiling are rising and falling.
The ceiling are shining and slow
peeling tongues from the ice hums and letting it go.

And the ceiling are rising and falling.
The ceiling are shining and slow
peeling tongues from the ice hums and letting it go.

Stump of a drowner.
The delta holder.
Lowered up from his boulder
and riding pains
steady blowout.

All those arms in the gullys
chewed through at the wrists.
All that won't flood awake –
– all that listens and lifts

Deserting your lead
while the figure is also carrying

Deserting your lead
while the figure is also carrying.

Your hands are drained.
Your skins are stained and heavy.

Go to ground
you are sealed against the night.
Spotted head blood head
heat up the stars.
Polish and silence away your parole.

She's a dugout;
her second sleeps
dreagging the roads.
Her fixed strays
shine from ditches

wherever she goes –

– Deserting your lead
while the figure is also carrying

Pry open those jaws
try and hear your own way out.

Driven in deep;
you save yourself the burying.

The darkness swarms;
Try and hear your own way out.

When I crossed the river
with a heavy blanket roll
I took nobody with me
not a soul.

I took a few provisions
some for comfort, some for cold
but I took nobody with me
not a soul.

This night you
are mistaken

I'm a farmer
in the city

Dark farm
houses
against the
sky

Every night
I must wonder
why

Harness on the
left nail keeps
wrinkling wrinkling

Then higher above
me - e e so o
e e e so o o

Can't go by
a man from
Rio

Can't go by
a man from

Can't go by

And if I'm not
mistaken
We can search
from farm to
farm

Dark farm houses
against our eyes

Every night I
must realize

Harness on the
left nail

Keeps withering
withering

Then higher above
me - e e so o
e e e so o o

Can't go by
a man in
this shirt

Can't go by
a man in
that shirt

Can't go by a man
with brain
grass

Go by his long
long eye
gas

And I used
to be a
citizen

I never felt
the pressure

I knew nothing
of the horses

Nothing of the
thresher

Paolo
take me with
you

It was the
journey of
a life

Do I hear

IT'S A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT

Feathers on the sides
Of my fingers

IT'S A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT
FROM HERE TO THOSE
TREMBLING STARS

And the feathers so
Fresh

And the nerves so
Fresh

Do you swear
The breastbone
Was bare

I saw it
And made my
Escape

Do you have
Any doubt
That he slept
In that bed

I can only
Repeat
I never saw
Him

Better listen
Before you fly
All over your
Man

Better listen
Before I spill
You in

If you could
Turn on your
Side

Move your touch
To that hip

Easy now

Easy now

It's a beautiful

Don't play

Those threads

The sobbing

us

Those tooth

He was so strong
he was so bold

When they made him

they broke the mold

If he heads this way
when the moon is slow

Come over and pray

they'll turn the buffalo

they'll turn the buffalo

There's a need to sleep
in the shag of his stomach

Slide around his eye
with your love in tow

If he heads this way
don't you say hello

Get out of the way

they'll turn the buffalo

they'll turn the buffalo

Stampede by my jacket

Someday I'll

A mother waits
as still as

Standing in

cold cold nose

What she feels so deep

Baby don't you weep

ain't got no no no

Tilt got none at all

Tilt
ain't got no no no
not at all

I'll string along

I'll string along

oo whaoo whaoo whaoo

Come morning

my beads on a face

A thread
A thong

oo whaoo whaoo whaoo

We can save it
We can change it

Put it in lines
across the room

But we'll never

stop it bristling

And I gotta quit

With a ribbonless hair

With a wire of snare

oo whaoo whaoo whaoo

With all the trembling vein

that you can bare

oo whaoo whaoo whaoo

We can save it
We can change it

Put it in lines
across the room

But we'll never stop it pimpling

And I gotta quit

Scrape a little pattern

to a sty

I kiss holes for the bullets

in case of thigh

in case of thigh

I kiss holes for the bullets

And I gotta quit
And I gotta quit


The Russians are going
The Russians are going

Departing like merchants
Dragging the contours
Into the never settling
Snow

Behold not a possum

Nothing to sneeze at

A rouble left
Spinning
Rouble keeps
Spinning

Oh where is
A sombre
Reverie?

Fingered

But I won't
Be soiled

I won't beg
Or lift
My
Voice

And I won't
Be soiled

The sun will never
Rise

But I will see
It

Spilling down
The slave ships
Cross the bay

A tear will never
Fall

But I will feel
It

Gliding on the
Cheekless

Gliding on the
Cheekless

Please

Cut her to
Ribbons again

Long flowing
Ribbons again

I'm wearing
The wire

On the outside
Grows the furside
On the inside
Grows the skinside
So the furside
Is the outside
And the skinside
Is the inside
Oneside likes the
Skinside inside
And the furside
On the outside
Others like the
Skinside outside
And the furside
On the inside
If you turn the
Skinside inside
Thinking you will
Side with that
Side then the
Softside fursides
Inside which
Some argue is
The wrong side
If you turn the
Furside outside
As you say it
Grows on that side
Then your outsides
Next to skinside
Which becomforts
Not the right side

Where do the
Sewers go?

They gotta go
Somewhere

I know they
Can't empty
Into the
Sea

Gotta go
Somewhere

Wherever the
Sewers go

That's where
You'll find
It

Soaring the
Darkness of
A life

It is the
Dagger

Not the
Knife

Fingered

But I won't
Be soiled

I won't beg
Or lift
My
Voice

And I won't
Be soiled

Early birds
Will not
Resolve
The issue

As runners
Leap to
Fly
Tree climbers
Glide to
Ground

Night without
A star

Is what a
Night is

And for me
A glass
To bring
The stars
Around

At the
Roadsides

Carts are
Piling up
With corpses

And breath

Just keeps on
Flowing

Up ahead
In the
Shadow

A bootleg
Is hooking

Please

Cut her to
Ribbons again

The Russians
Are going
The Russians
Are going

I'm wearing
The wire

Fire
Without
Smoke

Smoke
Without
Fire.

This is not a cornhusk doll
Dipped in blood in the moonlight
Like what happen in America
This is us
Our eyesides snagged
Dipped in mob in the daylight
Like what happen in America
The breasts are still heavy
The legs long and straight
The upper lip remains short
The teeth are too small
The eyeside is green
The hair long and black
Still coming through
Still coming through
She knows this room
She can navigate it in the dark
She entered the Palazzo at night by a side door
To ascend to a lift in the upper floor
She lies on the bed
Looking up not yet seeing
The signs of the zodiac painted in gold
On the blue vaulted ceiling
His enormous eyes as he arrives
Coming nearer in the surrounding darkness
His strange beliefs about the moon
Its influence upon men of affairs
The danger of its cold light on your face
While you were sleeping
She'll eclipse it with her head
Stroke him 'til he sleeps
Until he has nothing to do among men of affairs
Sometime before dawn
Her bare feet cross the floor
She gazes from the window
At the fountain in the courtyard
Sometimes I feel like a swallow
A swallow which by some mistake
Has gotten into an attic
And knocks its head against the walls in terror
This is not a rabbit skinned
With a body of silver
Like what happen in America
This is not a terrapin
With its shell torn away
Like what happen in America
The breasts are still heavy
The legs long and straight
The upper lip remains short
The teeth are too small
The eyeside is green
The hair long and black
Still coming through
Still coming through
The mood soon changed
In the clear morning air
A man came up towards the body
And poked it with a stick
It rocked swiftly
And twisted around at the end of the rope
Finer than a hair from every side
Finer than a hair
Birds
Birds
This is just a cornhusk doll
Dipped in blood in the moonlight
This is just a cornhusk doll
This morning in my room
A little swallow was trapped
It flew around desperately
Until it fell exhausted on my bed
I picked it up
So as not to frighten it
I opened the window
Then I opened my hand

Nose holes caked in black cocaine
Pow! Pow!
No one holds a match to your skin
No dupe
No chiming
A way off miles off
No needle through a glove
Famine is a tall tower
A building left in the night
Jesse are you listening?
It casts its ruins in shadows
Under Memphis moonlight
Jesse are you listening?
Six feet of foetus
Flung at sparrows in the sky
Put yourself in my shoes
A kiss, wet, muzzle
A clouded eye
No stars to flush it out
Famine is a tall tower
A building left in the night
Jesse are you listening?
It casts its ruins in shadows
Under Memphis moonlight
Jesse are you listening?
Pow! Pow!
In the dream
I am crawling around in my hands and knees
smoothing out the prairie
All the dents and the gouges
And the winds dying down
I lower my head
Press my ear to the prairie
Alive, I'm the only one
Left alive
I'm the only one
Left alive
I'm the only one
Left alive
Alive
I'm the only one
Left alive
I'm the only one
Left alive
I'm the only one
Left alive

As the grossness of spring lolls its head against the window
As the grossness of spring lolls its bloodshot head
Curare! Curare! Curare!
Brogue cries from the street
Curare! Curare!
As the grossness of spring rose
A tumor balloon to squeak against the window
With the grossness of spring staining into the walls
The chair had been shifted ever so slightly
Say five feet or two centimeters
The prints of my fingers dusted from doorknobs
A lamp had been dimmed
Some sawdust where a ring had been
Where nice girls were turned into whores
Gardens with fountains where peacocks had strutted
Where deaf children were born
The splendor of tigers turning to gold in the desert
Pale meadows of stranded pyramids
Sonny boy
such a sonny boy
There's a song in the air
Curare! Curare! Curare!
But the fair senorita don't seem to care
Curare! Curare! Curare!
As the grossness of spring lolls its head against the window
As the grossness of spring lolls its bloodshot head
I merely got up so slowly
Shuffled across the floor
Closed the door on the landing
Descending the stairs
Dipping into the street
The paralysed street
Brogue says "Good afternoon!"
I say "Good afternoon!"
"It's a lovely afternoon"
"Yes, it's a lovely afternoon"I
Into pockets unstitching so weighted with pins
Into eyes imploding on mazes of sins
The puddle beneath the cork
Bobbing on a mild chop that rolled in
Off the river Dix and the open water beyond
Brogue says
"I'LL PUNCH A DONKEY IN THE STREETS OF GALWAY"
Then me
"I'LL PUNCH A DONKEY IN THE STREETS OF GALWAY"
Brogue
"I'LL PUNCH A DONKEY IN THE STREETS OF GALWAY"
"I'LL PUNCH A DONKEY IN THE STREETS OF GALWAY"
Sonny boy
Such a sonny boy
In her voice, there's a flaw
Sonny boy
Such a sonny boy

What do Seoul/Sudan have in common?
Both start with an S

Chiming like mouse bells

Immunity won't feed on the bodies
Bones closing
Too soon at the tips
Won't feed on the bodies

Can't swallow it then bury it
From the voice flooded semen clotting to paste
Can't swallow it then bury it

Jigger raps pits

Shoes had to shine
Splicing to swine
Strain after strain after strain after strain

Mend

Beat the band
I tried
I tried
Shrugged off the splintering white bone
Teeth shaken out with a stroke
Brain running down along spear
from the wound in the eye hole
Stones pounding in
past the screens
past the shields
I felt the nail driving into my food
while I felt the nail driving into my hand
Rub a dub
God and bring
beat the band
I tried
I tried
what?
When you can't hear the bleating all night
Else he's strumming the springs of his cot
When?
What you can't see is
her tiny mouth
squealing and shrieking with laughter
Dispensing
with each little toe
each little finger
let them whirl away into the darkness
The pee pee soaked trousers
The torn muddied dress
No ankles at the gates at dusk
Ever caught the dawning
The audience is waiting
Its audience is waiting
Its audience is waiting
Its audience is waiting
No Fado live from last year's winning country
Twelve bunnies in a hutch for nine new weeks
The audience is waiting
Its audience is waiting
Its audience is waiting
Its audience is waiting
And it will catch my toes
It will catch my fingers
The pee pee soaked trousers
The torn muddied dress
Forever and ever

"Milosevic couldn't care less if Bosnia was recognized" a laughing Dr. Karadzic later told a television interviewer. He said, "Caligula proclaimed his horse senator but the horse never took his seat."

Polish the fork and stick the fork in him
Polish the fork and stick the fork in him
Shinier still and stick the fork in him
He's done boys
he's done boys
Where will you sleep my stomach
My second stomach through the trees
Handicapped
Buzzing out on the steppes
Spooking yourself in the breeze
Somebody dies
Somebody don't shave
Ruminating the slimy stars
Polish the fork and stick the fork in him
Kad Tad -- Kad Tad -- Kad Tad
Polish it more and stick the fork in him
Kad Tad -- Kad Tad -- Kad Tad
Shinier still and stick the fork in him
He's done boys

Faces of the grass go lenghtening (oor)
The lengthening faces through the ice and sun (ooor)
Faces lengthen go lengthening faces
Into lengthening faces from the branch to the grass
With buried heads they stand in full view
Eyes sliding of the faces up and up
Slide up the faces and up the sun
And up the faces go lengthening faces
Eyes are sliding above the tall and peaceful grass
Polish the fork and stick the fork in him
Kad Tad -- Kad Tad -- Kad Tad
Polish the fork and stick the fork in him
Kad Tad -- Kad Tad -- Kad Tad
Shinier still and stick the fork in him

Neath the bougie a thimble rigger slyly rolls the pea
Bye the bye the bye the bye
Red is patchy
Snows the silver
Bye the bye the bye the bye
Can't turn from a crotch in the darkness
To turn to the valley of a king
Ja-da ja-da ja-da ja-da

The car in front follows the long way around
Prey moves
Predator moves
Foreshortened angels hunting me down
Halle -- halle -- halle
Underkill
Sticks in gutters
Overkill
Is personal
Too many bullets
Rabbi crater
Keyed for action
hits the marks
I wish I was in Dixie
Sleet switches silence
To the shredding of larks
Serifot
Combs of honey
Kellipot
Saliva's coating
balls of money
You and me against the world
You and me against the world
You and me against the world
World about to end
World about to end
World about to end
Windblown hair in a windowless room
A lifeline of knuckles
Waddles into the afternoon
Look into its eyes
It will look into your eyes

Corneas misted
Put put put put
Color high
Put put put
Motionless
Put put put put
For seconds at a time
A hand that is cold in another colder
Put put put
And everything
Put put put put
within reach
This is a waltz for a dodo
A samba for Bambi
Gavotte for the Kaiser
Bolero for Beuys
A reel for Red Rosa
A polka for Tintin
Corneas misted
Put put put
Color high
Put put put
Motionless
Put put put put
One hand that is cold in another colder
Put put put
And everything
within reach

While plucking feathers from a swan song
Spring might gently press its thumbs against your eyes
While plucking feathers from a swan song
A cobweb melts within a womb

While plucking feathers from a swan song
An incontinent is singing Scarpia
While plucking feathers from a swan song

While plucking feathers from a swan song
A mythic instance of erotic impulse
While plucking feathers from a swan song
Is slipping under a surefire sign

While plucking feathers from a swan song
bdelloid rotifers join the chitterling circuit
While plucking feathers from a swan song

While plucking feathers from a swan song
Shit might pretzel Christ's intestines
While plucking feathers from a swan song
Being crushed from the inside out

While plucking feathers from a swan song
On the snow "Rummy" flaunts his unmanly dribble
While plucking feathers from a swan song

While plucking feathers from a swan song
A tiny laugh dirties everything it touches
While plucking feathers from a swan song
Night stops dripping through the stars

While plucking feathers from a swan song
Bast the sheet of jewels horizon to horizon

While plucking feathers from a swan song

Hence went and cracked an atom age old egg
Beneath my nose
The sky-clads ash with jettisoning the roost
I'm bumping into leghorns in the darkness

Excuse me
Dear god, excuse me

Accrue too flew and burned my teeth
With kitchen matches struck on stone
Boiling owls shriek
Arab widow flayed cadenzas

I'm wading through blue, vacant veins of Sterzing
The chiseller keeps slipping away

Cholesteroled mansions crowded with sulphured air
Dip to Kyrie's lone whistler in the shadows
Simitar sideburn, charging on the purple purlieus
Scrape to Goitres gray carnation through the stubble

Epicanthic knobbler of ninon
Arch to Macaronic mahout in the mascon

Ah, my old scabby Sachem
A sphinters tooting our tune
If only 'I' could pick you
Wed slosh, wed slide, we'd cling
'Round a kelloggs floor

His severed, yellow-eyes weeping
Da da da, da da da
From the spit-roast smoke curling
Da da da, da da da

"Rack off from this ravished slather"
"Keep your vile rattus small adult hand to yourself"
"Take your turnshoes and wobble"
"Turnshoes and wobble"

Jihad jive lobs leaking beanbag
Through a cut-out clowns astonished mouth
Shrivelled pods climb to the sun
Beneath your skirts

Then suddenly, there's hissing on the gumbo
I'm drowning in yonical tears

Grinding upheaval
Always affects the genitals
Sniff to breaths bereft Manhattans in the Duma

Unleavened bread-head
The window behind, alive with wheeze driven flakes
Bob to rotting grapes bunch brooch on chest of bruises

Nothing clears a room like removing a brain
Hail the rain
Hail the rain
Hail the rain

Ah, my sweet Sagamore wino
Face full of drunken ticks
If only I could sip you

Like flies sip at wide eyes
On a desert floor
We could move to the sticks
Say Earl's Court or Embankment
While the Thames flows black as camel piss
Let the icy thermals dervish around our feet

Dare, step out on me
I'll step out on you
Dare, step out on me
I'll step out on you

Bish Bosch and what more
Aare depositions for?

Eukaryotic gobbler of gavotte
Knee to deafening tiny feet upon the branches
Altair, Vega, Drogba and Deneb
Doff to dentist's stoop of moon above the haunches

Sealable nostrils
Squeezed through eye of coupling pin
Heil to ober-bearing night starting to smoulder

First fiddlers mark
Right there, under the jaw
Nod to double-bladed axe
Poised over shoulder

Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone

Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone

'Neath a protein moon
In a protein sky
Running protein fields
With my protein eye

There's a protein song
Howling through the meat
Driving protein bods
From my protein street

Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone

From the south, the Klan sends roses
Lymph-lacquered nails hover in waifed autumn sun
For dragging down the back of summer

From the east come killer poses
Khrushchev's shoe beats a black tattoo
In the middle of the day

From the north flow floats with quivering virgins
Fresh from frozen catacombs
Did ya spot the die-cut crosses?
Did ya?
Did ya?

Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone

'Neath a protein moon
In a protein sky
Running protein fields
With my protein eye

Here's to a lousy life
Here's to a lousy life
Here's to a lousy life
Here's to a lousy life

This is my job
I don't come around and put out your red light
When you work

What's the matter?
Didn't you get enough attention at home?

If shit were music
La da da, la da da
You'd be a brass band

Know what?
You should get an agent, oh yeah, yeah
Why sit in the dark handling yourself?

For Lavinia
Who goes like gynozoon
IX, I, V, IX, III, V, I

For the citizen
Whose joke lays in their hand
I, V, I, V, IX, IX, III

To play fugues
On Jove's Spam castanets
V, IX, IX, I, VI, IX, I

Cattle are slaughtered
Entrails examined
Spread out across the moon

The Tisza is rising
Topless bars overflowing
Pulsing through the flumes

Drop-kicked coloraturas
Fouling my ears
Bypassing an anorexic sky and

Scar jumping grafters
Chorion-crying
How can you stoop so high?

For Papiria
Who plops the Pantheon
IV, VI, IX, V, I, IX, I

For grosse Gauls
Who won't leave our sheep alone
V, I, VII, IX, I, IX, I

Norsemen do not eat the big pink mint
Flush hard
It's a long way to Athens

Gone from your wooden palace
The wild mice pelt clothes slipped from my toes
Where termites scribble the walls

Twisted forth and gone, "Little father"
The 'snip' off your nine-ninety-nine
Ffrom where you groomed yourself too small

No more dragging this wormy anus
'Round on shag piles from Persia to Thrace
I've severed my reeking gonads
Fed them to your shrunken face

Janus head
It's said will give good door
IX, IX, V, IX, I, IX, I

For a Roman
Who's proof that Greeks fucked bears
V, V, IX, VII, V, IV, I

Heard this one?
This'll kill ya
About the ropes of hair
Care of Venus the Bald
Tugging Mercs across the plain

Those measuring road-rashed bellies
A perte de vue to me night and day

The one about the saint
Sstranded high upon his pillar
Thirty summers, thirty winters
His constant visitor, his mother

But he'd stare into the distance
Ignored her calls from down below

"Did you ever throw your own mother's food back at her?"
"Did you ever tell her, 'Take this junk away.'?"
"What kind of unnatural son would do that to his own mother?"

The tasteless one about the bantam
Who couldn't climb a rung

Your Helipolis is scrapheap
Gone, the brown slug of your tongue

For eunuch Ron
Who sleeps at night across the emperor's bedroom door
III, V, IX, IX, I, V, I

Grostulating-Gorbi
Requires fresh packing
II, IX, V, I, IV, IX, I

Over, it's over
Syrinx screaming all around
Bar, bar, bar
Bar, bar, bar, bar, bar

Aquil-Aetos, aquil-aetos
Screaming all around
Filling up my life
Screaming all around

Bar, bar, bar
Bar, bar, bar, bar, bar

Over, it's over
Your Nibelung can't be found
Their shadowless shadows wiping me
Wiping me clean away

Bar, bar, bar
Bar, bar, bar, bar, bar

Where's the scent of pine torches
The lumbering caravans
The felt covered wagons, moving like galleons?

The 'wedgie', the 'melvy' to threaten the air?
Only fledge muffled long hollow bone-drums a-beating
The dark day behind us, the dark day ahead
The wind drone across skull goblets
Then Basel-cum-Strasbourg-cum-Frankfurt-cum-Speyer-cum

I hear the only place you're ever invited is outside

If brains were rain
You'd surely be a desert

Look, don't go to a mind reader
Go to a palmist
I know you've got a palm

Does your face hurt?
'Cause it's killing me

Cut to lost Lumbago City
I am perched against the sky
A banner shoal of sparrows
Sways in the twilight

Down there, as ish kabibbles
Schlepp the shade forever
Earth's hoary fontenelle
Weeps softly for a thumb thrust

A chorus of threadbare black-stockinged legs
Is fanning out into a frazzled black rose
No phalanxes fleeing like zippers of blood
Red plumes nodding between the horses' ears

Hey buddy, give it up
Hey pal, come down, join the living
Wanted: A lisping, hobbling, noseless runt
Phone: IX-IX-IX-IX-IX-IX-I

Remember:
"Someday you'll go far if you catch the right train."
How about
"You're so fat
When you wear a yellow raincoat, people scream, 'Taxi!'."

Then there's:
"You're so boring, you can't even evertain doubt."

I'll grease this pole behind me
Grease this pole behind me
Grease this pole
Grease this pole

There's an unfinished rumour doing the rounds
It seems the storks are seen returning to the rooftops
Carrying back their children
Clacking like dried palms

Loud enough to be heard from Reims to Orleans
River banks are cleared, bridges retaken
Oblivion, driven from the city street by street

So why have screams of laughter
The pissing stench of mares-milk beer
Come to bait your toad down from his toadstool?

And if I'm melancholic
And if I shed a tear

Don't forget to blink
Lest your eyeballs dry up
Fall out of their sockets
And dangle on your cheeks like Caesar's shrivelled coglione

It's when I hear a sawed-off coffin
Rolls beneath the Tisza

Hey bar
Ah, my noblest music
Hey bar, bar, bar, bar...

I'll grease this pole behind me
Grease this pole behind me
Grease this pole
Grease this pole

Over, it's over
But where's the electrons
Squeezing all around?
Burning up my life
Squeezing all around

Over, it's over
Only freezing all around

I greased that pole behind me
Greased that pole behind me
Your Nibelung can't be found

I've looked high and low for you
I guess I didn't look low enough

Don't move
I want to forget you just the way you are
I really hope your face clears up
You know, I think you've got nothing there

Infrared, infrared
I could drop into the darkness
It's so cold, infrared
What if I freeze and drop into the darkness?

Maman Neigho was frightened by Hawaiians
When all the veins ran out
When too much bone structure went missing
She thumbed the galleon Cacafuego

Forsook the eyebrows climbing into greasy black hairlines
Narcrotic leis yanked down around the melianomed ankles
Their putrid petals dropping, erasing the white shoes
Like a face being eaten by a jungle

Slabs of steam tables whiffing of onions and roses
Haunted Jacuzzis churning
All night the native bods squealing B-flat
Like choirs of pigs seeking revenge for stolen insulin

Blip, boost, bust, brother
That's how we copped a final
Reached this city without sound

Everywhere you turn
Bunkers of rubber hoses pronging up off the city's floor

Chirp, chime, clambaked, cups
Don't step on that rotting tartare

Just might bust your conk
Might lay your racket
Early black ickaroo

It's dense, tense
Unseen through, pound for pound
All the people,on the corners
Pushing each other around
Humping like buggers, touching like muggers
Pushing each other around

Adepocere in a zoot
Sloshing, karat, ballooning down the street
Thousand kilos simpy, forty stone send
Tips his skypiece, come to weigh me up

But I'm toned
Gut bucket
Ground grippers ready to trilly
Layin' down iron, togged to the bricks

Shh

Let's add a little shade
Try something apart from the hogshair
While Pope Julius affects his red slippers
Let Michelangelo tip-toe around in his dogskin boots

Shh

The powder on a chalky bosom
Rises and hangs in the air
Clouds crawling through protracted blue
Like souls of insects
From threshing haze
The scent of spider lilies

Sam P's bagged decapitation
Rotates to the ocean floor
Its nostrils are twitching and sniffing

Gabriel's gravy
Got your glasses on, gate
There's some mezz glimmers, a gammon V8

Twisters in the slammer
Frisking their whiskers
Till peola dim on the chime of black

It's dense, tense
Unseen through, pound for pound
Scratch and Jesus on the corner
Pushing each other around
Shoving like sluggers, touching like muggers
Pushing each other around

Snapping their caps, slidin' their jibs
Lampin' the brees, drapin' the trees

Oops, pardon the elbow
Let's just shift you over here
Sorry, I'm so clumsy
Take that accidently in the bollocks for a start

Seven brights jumped in port
Reached this city without sound
Kopasetic, on the corners
Pushing each other around
Everybody on the corners
Pushing each other around.

Joe below, hincty dicty
Slipped the pounders, fews and two
Knock me, boot me
Down in the land of darkness

Sweet Leilani, heavenly flower

November in July
Eyes glistening in darkness
Like freshly crushed flies

Fourteen bones held together
By avian phlegm
When the whistling has ended
I won't stale again

Slurry soul, unbearable clink
Fraying through tartared chink
Took the Dorgi, left the dent
Frozen fast in the sagging night

4/4 of silence, 5/4 of shame
When the sneezings subsided
I won't stare again

Ink-a-dink-a-dink
(Hej do, hej do)
A-dink-a-dink-a-dink-a-doo
(Hej do, hej do)

Jutland is crooning narcrotic Lorilies
(Ingen, ingenting, ingen, ingenting)
Awaiting command
Its huge snout wedged between my thighs
(Ingen, ingenting, ingen, ingenting)

Ink-a-dink-a-dink
(Hej do, hej do)
A-dink-a-dink-a-dink-a-doo
(Hej do, hej do)

Jutland is hvining while stars fall in thuds
(Ingen, ingenting, ingen, ingenting)
Flattening the cheek, like soft muffled scuds
(Ingen, ingenting, ingen, ingenting)

Tongues lick the lead Lego
They won't be denied
If you're listening to this
You must have survived

My only pige passed your only dreng
In Jutland's sheer city
(Farvel, farvel)

November in July
Apropolis lip to where acid-fast fly
Crepey and shiny guanine restrain
While out lifting scalp
I will not glare again

Took the shilling, ditched the score
Frozen fast in the lowering night
In the lowering left-testicle night

Heya, heya, heya, heya
Heya, heya, heya, heya

Room full of mice
Room full of mice
Room full of mice
Room full of mice

Heya, heya, heya, heya
Heya, heya, heya, heya

Room full of mice
Room full of mice
Room full of mice
Room full of mice

Blowing up bullfrogs with a straw
Blowing up bullfrogs with a straw
Blowing up bullfrogs with a straw
Staring into their eyes just before they burst

Heya, heya, heya, heya
Heya, heya, heya, heya

Room full of mice
Room full of mice
Room full of mice
Room full of mice

Heya, heya, heya, heya
Heya, heya, heya, heya

Room full of mice
Room full of mice
Room full of mice
Room full of mice

No ear, two tails, one eye, three toes
No ear, two tails, one eye, three toes
No ear, two tails, one eye, three toes

I am nurturant
Compassionate, caring
Not so much
Very much

I am out-going
Socially active
Not so much
Very much

My ideal partner
Should be assertive
Not so much
Very much

And nobody waited for fire
Nobody waited for fire
Nobody waited for fire

And nobody waited for fire
Nobody waited for fire
Nobody waited for fire

Most of the chaos
In my life is caused by
Internal factors
External factors

Faced with decision
I am most likely to
Pick and choose quickly
Explore all options

If I were a garden
I would most resemble
A wildflower garden
An English garden

And nobody waited for fire
Nobody waited for fire
Nobody waited for fire

And nobody waited for fire
Nobody waited for fire
Nobody waited for fire

When you turn in your sleep
Will you roll across the path?
When you turn in your sleep
Will you roll?

When you turn in your sleep
Will you roll across the path?
When you turn in your sleep
Will you roll?

I have control
Over desires and temptations
Not so much
Very much

I enjoy being bound
By obligations
Not so much
Very much

The mad dogs swarming
From her groin
You noticed
Didn't notice

And nobody waited for fire
Nobody waited for fire
Nobody waited for fire

And nobody waited for fire
Nobody waited for fire
Nobody waited for fire

Ah, The Wide Missouri

Dwellers
on
the bluff

Across
The Wide Missouri

Never enough
No,
Never enough.

Whip-poor-will
Whip-poor-will

Scissoring high,
in the trees,

A beating
would do me
a world
of good
Sneakin by

I am down
on my knees

A beating
would do me
a world
of good.

I took it
from
Saxon.

I took it
from
Dad.

From
Fat
Johnny Friendly.

From
3 vigilantes.

I took it
for
Wild One
And then
for
my sin

I took it
from
Lizbeth
again
and
again.

Ah, The Wide Missouri

Dwellers

Across

She's hidden her babies away

Their soft, gummy smiles
won't be gilding the menu.

The deer fly, the sand fly,
the tsetse can't find them.

The goon from the Stasi
is left far behind them.

Their delicate derma
won't witness a ray.

She's hidden her babies away

She's hidden her babies away

No 'Raindrops on roses'.
'Whiskers on kittens'.

They refuse to be blinded
by Rubens or Poussin.

They'll hardly be boarding
the 12:10 to Tucson.

Is she shaking them hard
in dry run cabaret?

She's hidden her babies away

Ho, Ho, watenay
Ho, Ho, watenay
Ho, Ho, watenay
I'm closing in.
I'm closing in.

She's hidden her babies away

And why bring them out
with no shelter to offer.

The nurseries and creches
are heavily with lush lice.

Bubonic, blue blankets,
run ragged with church mice.

The Havana has died
in the clam-shell ashtray.

She's hidden her babies away

She's hidden her babies away

From posed, high,
pelvic bridges.

Pearly bone
mountain ridges.

No hiccupy silence
to finger their traces.

No colicky moon
shines bright pain
on their faces.

She has slipped
through the dark
like a mother moray.

She's hidden her babies away

Ho, Ho, watenay
Ho, Ho, watenay
Ho, Ho, watenay
I'm closing in.
I'm closing in.

I've come searching,
from far and away.

A r-e-a-c-h-i-n-g,L-o-n-g-A-r-m-e-d
vet ape
feeling hard
for a breech birth.

I gaze up at the night
at the asterisk's blazing.

Til they straighten,
and like tiny spines,
fall to earth.

I bite down on this
as I dance
and I pray.

She's hidden her babies away

Why don't minstrels
