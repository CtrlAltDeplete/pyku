Such a beautiful and important evening! The forgotten man and woman will never be forgotten again. We will all come together as never before Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me "old" when I would NEVER call him "short and fat?"

Call it what you want it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country! Hope you like my nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the United States Supreme Court.

We cannot allow this horror to continue! We did it! Thank you to all of my great supporters we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media).

Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud! My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you! Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting NOW.

Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail! Subject to the receipt of further information I will be allowing as President the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened. If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS? Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY. Problem is we don‚Äôt have Stars anymore - except your President (just kidding of course)! Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election!

The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo. A perfectly executed strike last night.

I hope everyone is having a great Christmas then tomorrow it‚Äôs back to work in order to Make America Great Again (which is happening faster than anyone anticipated)!

My use of social media is not Presidential - it‚Äôs MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL. Make America Great Again! I use Social Media not because I like to but because it is the only way to fight a VERY dishonest and unfair ‚Äúpress‚Äù now often referred to as Fake News Media. Phony and non-existent ‚Äúsources‚Äù are being used more often than ever. Many stories &amp; reports a pure fiction! Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children especially my 11 year old son Barron are having a hard time with this. Sick! Just left hospital. Rep.

Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech. 45.6 million people watched the highest number in history. beat every other Network for the first time ever with 11.7 million people tuning in. Delivered from the heart! If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFLor other leagues he or she should not be allowed to disrespect.... Social Media Giants are silencing millions of people. Can‚Äôt do this even if it means we must continue to hear Fake News like CNN whose ratings have suffered gravely. People have to figure out what is real and what is not without censorship! THANK YOU! I hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration! My supporters are the smartest strongest most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history. It is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country. As we get stronger so does our country. Best numbers ever! HAPPY BIRTHDAY to our 40th President of the United States of America Ronald Reagan! What truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people. Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television Don Lemon. He made Lebron look smart which isn‚Äôt easy to do. I like Mike! We need to be smart vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety! If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag &amp; Country you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend! Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer‚Äôs office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of &amp; perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong! Over 90% approval rating for your all time favorite (I hope) President within the Republican Party and 52% overall. This despite all of the made up stories by the Fake News Media trying endlessly to make me look as bad and evil as possible. Look at the real villains please! ISIS is in retreat our economy is booming investments and jobs are pouring back into the country and so much more! Together there is nothing we can‚Äôt overcome--even a very biased media. We ARE Making America Great Again! When will the Democrats give us our Attorney General and rest of Cabinet! They should be ashamed of themselves! No wonder D.C. doesn't work! If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border. The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. If stalemate continues Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real long term budget no C.R.‚Äôs! Busy day planned in New York. Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government! Busy week planned with a heavy focus on jobs and national security.

Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path! When a car is sent to the United States from China there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%.

Good news: Toyota and Mazda announce giant new Huntsville Alabama plant which will produce over 300000 cars and SUV‚Äôs a year and employ 4000 people. Companies are coming back to the U.S. in a very big way. Congratulations Alabama! I have offered DACA a wonderful deal including a doubling in the number of recipients &amp; a twelve year pathway to citizenship for two reasons: (1) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem. (2) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA only use it! Since November 8th Election Day the Stock Market has posted $3.2 trillion in GAINS and consumer confidence is at a 15 year high. Jobs! When a country is no longer able to say who can and who cannot come in &amp; out especially for reasons of safety &amp;.security - big trouble! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy! SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow! My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth - and we will bring back our dreams! NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room. He killed 8 people badly injured 12. SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY! Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia because they will be coming nice and new and ‚Äúsmart!‚Äù You shouldn‚Äôt be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it! If you don‚Äôt have Borders you don‚Äôt have a Country! So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans. They won't put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear! Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives not just a freeze. Also no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned! There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world! Iran is playing with fire - they don't appreciate how "kind" President Obama was to them. Not me! Thank you for the great rallies all across the country. Tremendous support. Make America Great Again! Professional anarchists thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! If the ban were announced with a one week notice the "bad" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad "dudes" out there! The United States is considering in addition to other options stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea. .....Be happy be cool! A football game that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy is no place to protest. Most of that money goes to the players anyway. Find another way to protest. Stand proudly for your National Anthem or be Suspended Without Pay! Today we remember the crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger 31 years later. #NeverForget ...Senators should focus their energies on ISIS illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. Happy 241st birthday to the U.S. Marine Corps! Thank you for your service!! Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can‚Äôt let that happen! Today we express our deepest gratitude to all those who have served in our armed forces. #ThankAVet I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health. Also good meeting with Kim Jong Un. Date &amp; Place set. Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck! Congratulations and on the successful #FalconHeavy launch. This achievement along with commercial and international partners continues to show American ingenuity at its best!

Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named ‚ÄúMan (Person) of the Year‚Äù like last year but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway! Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford Chairman of Ford who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico A big salute to Jerry Jones owner of the Dallas Cowboys who will BENCH players who disrespect our Flag."Stand for Anthem or sit for game!" Thank you for joining us at the Lincoln Memorial tonight- a very special evening! Together we are going to MAKE AM‚Ä¶ MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Andrew McCabe FIRED a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI! Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump? They were headed for 10 years in jail! So funny to watch the Fake News especially NBC and CNN. They are fighting hard to downplay the deal with North Korea. 500 days ago they would have ‚Äúbegged‚Äù for this deal-looked like war would break out. Our Country‚Äôs biggest enemy is the Fake News so easily promulgated by fools! Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that ‚ÄúABC does not tolerate comments like those‚Äù made by Roseanne Barr. Gee he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn‚Äôt get the call? A new radical Islamic terrorist has just attacked in Louvre Museum in Paris. Tourists were locked down. France on edge again. GET SMART U.S. At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is "no reason to be alarmed!" Where was all the outrage from Democrats and the opposition party (the media) when our jobs were fleeing our country?

Please to inform that the Champion Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL will be joining me at the White House for Ceremony. Great team! How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! Congratulations to Maxine Waters whose crazy rants have made her together with Nancy Pelosi the unhinged FACE of the Democrat Party. Together they will Make America Weak Again! But have no fear America is now stronger than ever before and I‚Äôm not going anywhere! I as President want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again people coming in through a system based on MERIT. No more Lotteries! #AMERICA FIRST ‚ÄúYou had Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party try to hide the fact that they gave money to GPS Fusion to create a Dossier which was used by their allies in the Obama Administration to convince a Court misleadingly by all accounts to spy on the Trump Team.‚Äù Tom Fitton JW Any negative polls are fake news just like the CNN ABC NBC polls in the election. Sorry people want border security and extreme vetting. ...our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!

But remember LaVar shoplifting is NOT a little thing. It‚Äôs a really big deal especially in China. Ungrateful fool! Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants or Illegal Immigrants ‚ÄúAnimals.‚Äù Wrong! They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as ‚ÄúAnimals‚Äù a big difference - and so true. Fake News got it purposely wrong as usual! So proud of our great Military which will soon be after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars the finest that our Country has ever had. There won‚Äôt be anything or anyone even close! Mexico has taken advantage of the U.S. for long enough. Massive trade deficits &amp; little help on the very weak border must change NOW! Heading to Joint Base Andrews on #MarineOne with Prime Minister Shinz≈ç earlier today. the American people. I have no doubt that we will together MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Twitter ‚ÄúSHADOW BANNING‚Äù prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints. ‚ÄúI REALLY DON‚ÄôT CARE DO U?‚Äù written on the back of Melania‚Äôs jacket refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are and she truly no longer cares! Great to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House. Melania is feeling and doing really well. Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes! Our great First Lady is doing really well. Will be leaving hospital in 2 or 3 days. Thank you for so much love and support! The opinion of this so-called judge which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country is ridiculous and will be overturned! Unemployment is down to 4.1% lowest in 17 years. 1.5 million new jobs created since I took office.

Great meeting with today talked about prison reform and sentencing. A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration. When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing not a bad thing. There always playing politics - bad for our country. I want to solve North Korea Syria Ukraine terrorism and Russia can greatly help! Maybe the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN should have their own rally. It would be the biggest of them all! I want to applaud the many protestors in Boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate. Our country will soon come together as one! The United States has ended the ridiculous 230 Million Dollar yearly development payment to Syria. Saudi Arabia and other rich countries in the Middle East will start making payments instead of the U.S. I want to develop the U.S. our military and countries that help us! ...NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S. Democrats are not interested in Border Safety &amp; Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military. They are only interested in Obstruction! Stock Market hits an ALL-TIME high! Unemployment lowest in 16 years! Business and manufacturing enthusiasm at highest level in decades! Marshawn Lynch of the NFL‚Äôs Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican Anthem and sits down to boos for our National Anthem. Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season.

It is a disgrace that my full Cabinet is still not in place the longest such delay in the history of our country. Obstruction by Democrats!

So why does the media refuse to write this? Oh well someday! Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand! So President Obama knew about Russia before the Election.

We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and much faster than anyone thought possible! I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL which is desperately needed for our National Defense is not fully funded. When people come into our Country illegally we must IMMEDIATELY escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering. Our laws are the dumbest anywhere in the world. Republicans want Strong Borders and no Crime. Dems want Open Borders and are weak on Crime! It‚Äôs very sad that Nancy Pelosi and her sidekick Cryin‚Äô Chuck Schumer want to protect illegal immigrants far more than the citizens of our country. The United States cannot stand for this. We wants safety and security at our borders! Cryin‚Äô Chuck Schumer fully understands especially after his humiliating defeat that if there is no Wall there is no DACA. We must have safety and security together with a strong Military for our great people! For those asking the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate and they need 60. That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election! We can then be even tougher on Crime (and Border) and even better to our Military &amp; Veterans! Since the first day I took office all you hear is the phony Democrat excuse for losing the election Russia RussiaRussia. Despite this I have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any 10 month President. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The Trump Administration has terminated more UNNECESSARY Regulation in just twelve months than any other Administration has terminated during their full term in office no matter what the length. The good news is THERE IS MUCH MORE TO COME! The Christmas Story begins 2000 years ago with a mother a father their baby son and the most extraordinary gift of all‚Äîthe gift of God‚Äôs love for all of humanity.Whatever our beliefs we know that the birth of Jesus Christ and the story of his life... Countries charge U.S. companies taxes or tariffs while the U.S. charges them nothing or little.We should charge them SAME as they charge us! The only thing that I have done wrong is to win an election that was expected to be won by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. The problem is they forgot to campaign in numerous states! Sorry we cannot let our friends or enemies take advantage of us on Trade anymore. We must put the American worker first! Crooked H destroyed phones w/ hammer 'bleached' emails &amp; had husband meet w/AG days before she was cleared- &amp; they talk about obstruction? I‚Äôve had to beat 17 very talented people including the Bush Dynasty then I had to beat the Clinton Dynasty and now I have to beat a phony Witch Hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the IG Report...and never forget the Fake News Media. It never ends! We should have a contest as to which of the Networks plus CNN and not including Fox is the most dishonest corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY! I fulfilled my campaign promise - others didn‚Äôt! Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza today.

The hostages are back home with their families. Thank you to Chairman Kim our day together was historic! Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey who at one point I knew very well interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others! Here‚Äôs a great stat - since January 2017 the number of people forced to use food stamps is down 1.9 million. The American people are finally back to work! I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt Will soon be heading to Davos Switzerland to tell the world how great America is and is doing. Our economy is now booming and with all I am doing will only get better...Our country is finally WINNING again! Congratulations to France who played extraordinary soccer on winning the 2018 World Cup. Additionally congratulations to President Putin and Russia for putting on a truly great World Cup Tournament -- one of the best ever! I got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin. In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy. If I was loud &amp; vicious I would have been criticized for being too tough. Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim? Hypocrites! AMERICA FIRST! The Republicans have now won 8 out of 9 House Seats yet if you listen to the Fake News Media you would think we are being clobbered. Why can‚Äôt they play it straight so unfair to the Republican Party and in particular your favorite President! Big story out that the FBI ignored tens of thousands of Crooked Hillary Emails many of which are REALLY BAD. Also gave false election info. I feel sure that we will soon be getting to the bottom of all of this corruption. At some point I may have to get involved! Nancy Pelosi and Fake Tears Chuck Schumer held a rally at the steps of The Supreme Court and mic did not work (a mess)-just like Dem party!

As your President I have no higher duty than to protect the lives of the American people. I am proud to have fought for and secured the LOWEST African American and Hispanic unemployment rates in history. Now I‚Äôm pushing for prison reform to give people who have paid their debt to society a second chance. I will never stop fighting for ALL Americans! I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020? My answer was "I hope so!" Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! Today we remember the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in serving. Thank you God bless your families &amp; God bless the USA! #MerryChristmas I am extremely pleased to see that has finally been exposed as #FakeNews and garbage journalism. It's about time! If anyone is looking for a good lawyer I would strongly suggest that you don‚Äôt retain the services of Michael Cohen! Border Patrol Officer killed at Southern Border another badly hurt. We will seek out and bring to justice those responsible. We will and must build the Wall! To the great and brave men and women of ICE do not worry or lose your spirit. You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements. So brave! The radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police. Zero chance It will never happen! Just won lawsuit filed by the DNC and a bunch of Democrat crazies trying to claim the Trump Campaign (and others) colluded with Russia. They haven‚Äôt figured out that this was an excuse for them losing the election! MERRY CHRISTMAS!! Thank you for all of the nice statements on the Press Conference yesterday. Rush Limbaugh said one of greatest ever. Fake media not happy! The fact that I am having a meeting is a major loss for the U.S. say the haters &amp; losers. We have our hostages testing research and all missle launches have stoped and these pundits who have called me wrong from the beginning have nothing else they can say! We will be fine! The GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man. The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man Mike Pence. Apologize! We should start an immediate investigation into and his ties to Russia and Putin. A total hypocrite! I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program. Being politically correct is fine but not for this! Getting ready to leave for Washington D.C. The journey begins and I will be working and fighting very hard to make it a great journey for.. I am pleased to inform you that I have just granted a full Pardon to 85 year old American patriot Sheriff Joe Arpaio. He kept Arizona safe! Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady Melania. Successful procedure she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers! I promise that our administration will ALWAYS have your back. We will ALWAYS be with you! Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud! Thank you to Prime Minister of Australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about. Very nice! North Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life? Hard to believe that South Korea..... MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone even with bad intentions can come into U.S.? The crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise. Gang members drug dealers &amp; others are being removed! So much Fake News is being reported. They don‚Äôt even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong. They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information. The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election! Thank you to Kanye West and the fact that he is willing to tell the TRUTH. One new and great FACT - African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in the history of our Country. So honored by this. Thank you Kanye for your support. It is making a big difference! CNN‚ÄôS slogan is CNN THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS. Everyone knows this is not true that this could in fact be a fraud on the American Public. There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN. Their slogan should be CNN THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS! The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. From this moment on it‚Äôs going to be #AmericaFirstüá∫üá∏ I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad! Despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don‚Äôt know and/or have never met. FAKE NEWS! These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years. Why didn‚Äôt Obama do something about it? Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win that‚Äôs why. Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration but Fake News doesn‚Äôt want to report the truth as usual! Congresswoman Maxine Waters an extraordinarily low IQ person has become together with Nancy Pelosi the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters of which there are many of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! Tremendous investment by companies from all over the world being made in America. There has never been anything like it. Now Disney J.P. Morgan Chase and many others. Massive Regulation Reduction and Tax Cuts are making us a powerhouse again. Long way to go! Jobs Jobs Jobs! The Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin is dead. She was a great woman with a wonderful gift from God her voice. She will be missed! I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult! Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time showed RESPECT for our National Anthem! üá∫üá∏üáØüá≤ Kanye West has performed a great service to the Black Community - Big things are happening and eyes are being opened for the first time in Decades - Legacy Stuff! Thank you also to Chance and Dr. Darrell Scott they really get it (lowest Black &amp; Hispanic unemployment in history). Before taking office people were assuming that we were going to War with North Korea. President Obama said that North Korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem. No longer - sleep well tonight! They asked my daughter Ivanka whether or not the media is the enemy of the people. She correctly said no. It is the FAKE NEWS which is a large percentage of the media that is the enemy of the people! Big week next week when the American Embassy in Israel will be moved to Jerusalem. Congratulations to all! The threat from radical Islamic terrorism is very real just look at what is happening in Europe and the Middle-East. Courts must act fast! Horrible and cowardly terrorist attack on innocent and defenseless worshipers in Egypt. The world cannot tolerate terrorism we must defeat them militarily and discredit the extremist ideology that forms the basis of their existence! Just got recent Poll - much higher than President O at same time....Well much more has been accomplished! Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border. They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess! We have to maintain strong borders or we will no longer have a country that we can be proud of ‚Äì and if we show any weakness millions of people will journey into our country. Space Force all the way! Radical Islamic Terrorism must be stopped by whatever means necessary! The courts must give us back our protective rights. Have to be tough! So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed while Crooked Hillary Clinton on that now famous FBI holiday ‚Äúinterrogation‚Äù with no swearing in and no recording lies many times...and nothing happens to her? Rigged system or just a double standard? Happy birthday to U.S. ARMY and our soldiers. Thank you for your bravery sacrifices &amp; dedication. Proud to be your Commander-in-Chief! They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story found zero proof so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice We are not in a trade war with China that war was lost many years ago by the foolish or incompetent people who represented the U.S. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue! Have a great but very reflective President‚Äôs Day! HillaryClinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate &amp; delete 33000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media? We must not allow ISIS to return or enter our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere. Enough! Leaving now for Texas! Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife‚Äôs campaign by Crooked H friend Terry M who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all and much more! ....victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you ....untruthful slime ball who was as time has proven a terrible Director of the FBI. His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case and the events surrounding it will go down as one of the worst ‚Äúbotch jobs‚Äù of history. It was my great honor to fire James Comey! Mexico was just ranked the second deadliest country in the world after only Syria. Drug trade is largely the cause. We will BUILD THE WALL! So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed linebacker Edwin Jackson. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border and with illegal immigration FAST! A message from Kim Jong Un: ‚ÄúNorth Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles.‚ÄùAlso will ‚ÄúShut down a nuclear test site in the country‚Äôs Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests.‚Äù Progress being made for all! Why should I as President of the United States allow countries to continue to make Massive Trade Surpluses as they have for decades while our Farmers Workers &amp; Taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay? Not fair to the PEOPLE of America! $800 Billion Trade Deficit... My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana a true friend and patriot was badly injured but will fully recover. Our thoughts and prayers are with him. Little Adam Schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington right up there with Comey Warner Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped! Our great country has been divided for decades. Sometimes you need protest in order to heal &amp; we will heal &amp; be stronger than ever before! We stand in absolute solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom. The Democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration &amp; ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost! My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in South Carolina. Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work they‚Äôve done! This memo totally vindicates ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace! The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule if a restaurant is dirty on the outside it is dirty on the inside! The U.S. is working very closely with the Government of Thailand to help get all of the children out of the cave and to safety. Very brave and talented people! Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents but costs are out of control more than $4 billion. Cancel order! Just hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll much higher than President Obama at same point. With all of the phony stories and Fake News it‚Äôs hard to believe! Thank you America we are doing Great Things. Why aren‚Äôt they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show? A total double standard but that‚Äôs O.K. we are Winning and will be doing so for a long time to come! Just leaving Florida. Big crowds of enthusiastic supporters lining the road that the FAKE NEWS media refuses to mention. Very dishonest! Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014 long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion! Alec Baldwin whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on SNL now says playing me was agony. Alec it was agony for those who were forced to watch. Bring back Darrell Hammond funnier and a far greater talent! Democrats please do not distance yourselves from Nancy Pelosi. She is a wonderful person whose ideas &amp; policies may be bad but who should definitely be given a 4th chance. She is trying very hard &amp; has every right to take down the Democrat Party if she has veered too far left! If the press would cover me accurately &amp; honorably I would have far less reason to "tweet." Sadly I don't know if that will ever happen! Together we will prevail in the GREAT state of Texas. We love you!GOD BLESS TEXAS &amp; GOD BLESS THE USAüá∫üá∏ The United States Senate just passed the biggest in history Tax Cut and Reform Bill. Terrible Individual Mandate (ObamaCare)Repealed. Goes to the House tomorrow morning for final vote. If approved there will be a News Conference at The White House at approximately 1:00 P.M. Give the public a break - The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT! Our Nation was founded by farmers. Our independence was won by farmers. And our continent was tamed by farmers. Our farmers always lead the way -- we are PROUD of them and we are DELIVERING for them! #NationalAgricultureDay Very grateful for the 9-O decision from the U. S. Supreme Court. We must keep America SAFE! Can you believe that with all of the made up unsourced stories I get from the Fake News Media together with the $10000000 Russian Witch Hunt (there is no Collusion) I now have my best Poll Numbers in a year. Much of the Media may be corrupt but the People truly get it! At the request of the Governor of Texas I have signed the Disaster Proclamation which unleashes the full force of government help! I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to know him well--he's a greatly talented person who loves people! The Fake News refuses to talk about how Big and how Strong our BASE is. They show Fake Polls just like they report Fake News. Despite only negative reporting we are doing well - nobody is going to beat us. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Only the Fake News Media and Trump enemies want me to stop using Social Media (110 million people). Only way for me to get the truth out! Jobs are returning illegal immigration is plummeting law order and justice are being restored. We are truly making America great again! Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death &amp; destruction! This will be a big week for Infrastructure. After so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the Middle East it is now time to start investing in OUR Country! The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. Rank &amp; File are great people! ....Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards NATO while we pay 4% of a MUCH larger GDP. Does anybody believe that makes sense? We protect Europe (which is good) at great financial loss and then get unfairly clobbered on Trade. Change is coming! Stock Market up almost 40% since the Election with 7 Trillion Dollars of U.S. value built throughout the economy. Lowest unemployment rate in many decades with Black &amp; Hispanic unemployment lowest in History and Female unemployment lowest in 21 years. Highest confidence ever! The Fake Mainstream Media has from the time I announced I was running for President run the most highly sophisticated &amp; dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics. No matter how well WE do they find fault. But the forgotten men &amp; women WON I‚Äôm President! I am working hard even on Thanksgiving trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon! Many reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with regime‚Äôs corruption &amp; its squandering of the nation‚Äôs wealth to fund terrorism abroad. Iranian govt should respect their people‚Äôs rights including right to express themselves. The world is watching! #IranProtests Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is obviously a very poor and troubled country. Never said ‚Äútake them out.‚Äù Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately no trust! Another false story this time in the Failing that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day - Wrong! Also I seldom if ever watch CNN or MSNBC both of which I consider Fake News. I never watch Don Lemon who I once called the ‚Äúdumbest man on television!‚Äù Bad Reporting. The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military. Getting ready to celebrate the 4th of July with a big crowd at the White House. Happy 4th to everyone. Our country will grow and prosper! Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem Flag and Country? Change tax law! Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! NEW FBI TEXTS ARE BOMBSHELLS! John Kerry can‚Äôt get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it! Stay away from negotiations John you are hurting your country! ....Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming..... Heading to beautiful West Virginia to be with great members of the Republican Party. Will be planning Infrastructure and discussing Immigration and DACA not easy when we have no support from the Democrats. NOT ONE DEM VOTED FOR OUR TAX CUT BILL! Need more Republicans in ‚Äò18. Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). These are fans who demand respect for our Flag! Candace Owens of Turning Point USA is having a big impact on politics in our Country. She represents an ever expanding group of very smart ‚Äúthinkers‚Äù and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on...so good for our Country! JUST OUT: 3.9% Unemployment. 4% is Broken! In the meantime WITCH HUNT! I love the White House one of the most beautiful buildings (homes) I have ever seen. But Fake News said I called it a dump - TOTALLY UNTRUE Wow looks like James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over...and so much more. A rigged system! ...can't change history but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee Stonewall Jackson - who's next Washington Jefferson? So foolish! Also... Despite the disgusting illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S. history - by far! Sorry to the Fake News Media and ‚ÄúHaters‚Äù but that‚Äôs the way it is! The Iran sanctions have officially been cast. These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed and in November they ratchet up to yet another level. Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE nothing less! AUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD. Great job by law enforcement and all concerned! I will represent our country well and fight for its interests! Fake News Media will never cover me accurately but who cares! We will #MAGA! Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process? Because the ban was lifted by a judge many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision It is so pathetic that the Dems have still not approved my full Cabinet. Big news - Budget just passed! Stock Market at all time high unemployment at lowest level in years (wages will start going up) and our base has never been stronger! The riots in Charlottesville a year ago resulted in senseless death and division. We must come together as a nation. I condemn all types of racism and acts of violence. Peace to ALL Americans! Fire at Trump Tower is out. Very confined (well built building). Firemen (and women) did a great job. THANK YOU! The hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI &amp; DOJ should be shown to the public on live television not a closed door hearing that nobody will see. We should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency! Great jobs numbers and finally after many years rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. Only Russia Russia Russia despite the fact that after a year of looking there is No Collusion! North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help that would be great. If not we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A. Secret Service has just informed me that Senator Jon Tester‚Äôs statements on Admiral Jackson are not true. There were no such findings. A horrible thing that we in D.C. must live with just like phony Russian Collusion. Tester should lose race in Montana. Very dishonest and sick! Shoplifting is a very big deal in China as it should be (5-10 years in jail) but not to father LaVar. Should have gotten his son out during my next trip to China instead. China told them why they were released. Very ungrateful! I don‚Äôt blame China I blame the incompetence of past Admins for allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. on trade leading up to a point where the U.S. is losing $100's of billions. How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue? I would've done same! Looking forward to a speedy recovery for George and Barbara Bush both hospitalized. Thank you for your wonderful letter! Stock Market hit all time high on Friday. Congratulations U.S.A.! I would be willing to ‚Äúshut down‚Äù government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security which includes the Wall! Must get rid of Lottery Catch &amp; Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country! When you see ‚Äúanonymous source‚Äù stop reading the story it is fiction! Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings! While in the Philippines I was forced to watch which I have not done in months and again realized how bad and FAKE it is. Loser! Presidential Approval numbers are very good - strong economy military and just about everything else. Better numbers than Obama at this point by far. We are winning on just about every front and for that reason there will not be a Blue Wave but there might be a Red Wave! I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. I am also directing the State Department to begin preparation to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem... RED WAVE! I have asked Secretary of State to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. ‚ÄúSouth African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.‚Äù The Fake News Media hates when I use what has turned out to be my very powerful Social Media - over 100 million people! I can go around them If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing they would be scorned &amp; called terrible names! Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man they won't be around much longer! Congratulations to our great military men and women for representing the United States and the world so well in the Syria attack. Wishing Melania and all of the great mothers out there a wonderful day ahead with family and friends! Happy #MothersDay There is nothing that I would want more for our Country than true FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. The fact is that the Press is FREE to write and say anything it wants but much of what it says is FAKE NEWS pushing a political agenda or just plain trying to hurt people. HONESTY WINS! I asked Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and Karen. So sad to see the Terror Attack in Paris. At some point countries will have to open their eyes &amp; see what is really going on. This kind of sickness &amp; hatred is not compatible with a loving peaceful &amp; successful country! Changes to our thought process on terror must be made. Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You..... In one of the biggest stories in a long time the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers Strzok-Page texts perhaps 50000 and all in prime time. Wow! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States and all of its GREAT people should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea! THE WEST WILL NEVER BE BROKEN. Our values will PREVAIL. Our people will THRIVE and our civilization will TRIUMPH! It's very sad that Republicans even some that were carried over the line on my back do very little to protect their President. Congratulations to all of the ‚ÄùDEPLORABLES‚Äù and the millions of people who gave us a MASSIVE (304-227) Electoral College landslide victory! President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling he said it couldn‚Äôt happen was no big deal &amp; did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok! Hundreds of Bikers for Trump just joined me at Bedminster. Quite a scene - great people who truly love our Country! Just read the nice remarks by President Jimmy Carter about me and how badly I am treated by the press (Fake News). Thank you Mr. President! protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer. Secretary Kelly said that all is going well with very few problems. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! May God Forever Bless the United States of America. #NeverForget911 Big win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown. Now I want a big win for everyone including Republicans Democrats and DACA but especially for our Great Military and Border Security. Should be able to get there. See you at the negotiating table! So much Fake News. Never been more voluminous or more inaccurate. But through it all our country is doing great! Representative Devin Nunes a man of tremendous courage and grit may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure! The Liberal Left also known as the Democrats want to get rid of ICE who do a fantastic job and want Open Borders. Crime would be rampant and uncontrollable! Make America Great Again Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch &amp; Release. Getting more dangerous. ‚ÄúCaravans‚Äù coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL! Bus crash in Tennessee so sad &amp; so terrible. Condolences to all family members and loved ones. These beautiful children will be remembered! The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens. Not good! The terrorist came into our country through what is called the "Diversity Visa Lottery Program" a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based. I will be making my Supreme Court pick on Thursday of next week.Thank you! Remember Sunday is National Prayer Day (by Presidential Proclamation)! ....People are angry. At some point the Justice Department and the FBI must do what is right and proper. The American public deserves it! Happy Mother‚Äôs Day!!! Signing orders to move forward with the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines in the Oval Off‚Ä¶ Based on Justin‚Äôs false statements at his news conference and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers workers and companies I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market! Can you believe that despite 93% bad stories from the Fake News Media (should be getting good stories) today we had just about our highest Poll Numbers including those on Election Day? The American public is wise to the phony an dishonest press. Make America Great Again! Well the Special Elections are over and those that want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN are 5 and O! All the Fake News all the money spent = 0 A vote for Democrats in November is a vote to let MS-13 run wild in our communities to let drugs pour into our cities and to take jobs and benefits away from hardworking Americans. Democrats want anarchy amnesty and chaos - Republicans want LAW ORDER and JUSTICE! I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October just prior to Election! At some point the Fake News will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers strong economy success with ISIS the border &amp; so much else! Another terrorist attack in London...These animals are crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength! Funny to hear the Democrats talking about the National Debt when President Obama doubled it in only 8 years! ...Hopefully we will never have to use this power but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world! Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November? Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win. Unprecedented. Bigger than Watergate! Plus Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling. If ObamaCare is hurting people &amp; it is why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies &amp; why should Congress not be paying what public pays? I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing not a bad thing....... IN AMERICA WE DON'T WORSHIP GOVERNMENT - WE WORSHIP Only 109 people out of 325000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage..... Unprecedented success for our Country in so many ways since the Election. Record Stock Market Strong on Military Crime Borders &amp; ISIS Judicial Strength &amp; Numbers Lowest Unemployment for Women &amp; ALL Massive Tax Cuts end of Individual Mandate - and so much more. Big 2018! ...a tool of anti-Trump political actors. This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law....The FBI wasn‚Äôt straight with Congress as it hid most of these facts from investigators.‚Äù Wall Street Journal All signs are that business is looking really good for next year only to be helped further by our Tax Cut Bill. Will be a great year for Companies and JOBS! Stock Market is poised for another year of SUCCESS! Robert De Niro a very Low IQ individual has received to many shots to the head by real boxers in movies. I watched him last night and truly believe he may be ‚Äúpunch-drunk.‚Äù I guess he doesn‚Äôt... Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm law-abiding Americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets. Politicians who put criminal aliens before American Citizens should be voted out of office! ‚ÄúThe four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath....The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier....the FBI became.... Just signed Bill. Our Military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything ‚Äî and more. First time this has happened in a long time. Also means JOBS JOBS JOBS! The Rigged Witch Hunt originally headed by FBI lover boy Peter S (for one year) &amp; now 13 Angry Democrats should look into the missing DNC Server Crooked Hillary‚Äôs illegally deleted Emails the Pakistani Fraudster Uranium One Podesta &amp; so much more. It‚Äôs a Democrat Con Job! I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others they pay little or no taxes to state &amp; local governments use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.) and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business! Heading back to Washington after working hard and watching some of the worst and most dishonest Fake News reporting I have ever seen! Congratulations to Thomas Perez who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him or for the Republican Party! The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border always committing crimes and being violent and yet this info was not used in court. His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. BUILD THE WALL! Happy Memorial Day! Those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today. Best economy in decades lowest unemployment numbers for Blacks and Hispanics EVER (&amp; women in 18years) rebuilding our Military and so much more. Nice! Kim Jong Un of North Korea who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people will be tested like never before! Thank you to Chairman Kim Jong Un for keeping your word &amp; starting the process of sending home the remains of our great and beloved missing fallen! I am not at all surprised that you took this kind action. Also thank you for your nice letter - l look forward to seeing you soon! The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our ‚Äúvery stupid‚Äù trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more! Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia. They would rather go to war than see this. It‚Äôs called Trump Derangement Syndrome! Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe but he never took notes when he was with me. I don‚Äôt believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos? I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD including those registered to vote in two states those who are illegal and.... The FAKE &amp; FRAUDULENT NEWS MEDIA is working hard to convince Republicans and others I should not use social media - but remember I won.... When you‚Äôre almost 800 Billion Dollars a year down on Trade you can‚Äôt lose a Trade War! The U.S. has been ripped off by other countries for years on Trade time to get smart! This is my 500th. Day in Office and we have accomplished a lot - many believe more than any President in his first 500 days. Massive Tax &amp; Regulation Cuts Military &amp; Vets Lower Crime &amp; Illegal Immigration Stronger Borders Judgeships Best Economy &amp; Jobs EVER and much more... We will always take care of our GREAT VETERANS. You have shed your blood poured your love and bared your soul in‚Ä¶ Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST! Big wins against ISIS! Even Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN agrees: ‚ÄúTrump World and WH sources dancing in end zone: Trump wins again...Schumer and Dems caved...gambled and lost.‚Äù Thank you for your honesty Jim! The "Unaffordable" Care Act will soon be history! The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy! My experience yesterday in Poland was a great one. Thank you to everyone including the haters for the great reviews of the speech! The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is. They totally misrepresent what I say about hate bigotry etc. Shame! The United States made some of the worst Trade Deals in world history.Why should we continue these deals with countries that do not help us? Made additional remarks on Charlottesville and realize once again that the #Fake News Media will never be satisfied...truly bad people! Just signed 702 Bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection. This is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election. I will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the American people first! Democrats fix the laws. Don‚Äôt RESIST. We are doing a far better job than Bush and Obama but we need strength and security at the Border! Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country. Strong Borders No Crime! I will be meeting General Kelly General Mattis and other military leaders at the White House to discuss North Korea. Thank you. Put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts. Under study for years. Will update soon with Secretary Zinke. Thank you! Ungrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning who should never have been released from prison is now calling President Obama a weak leader. Terrible! The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by "intelligence" like candy. Very un-American! ....Our Immigration policy laughed at all over the world is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years! Immigration must be based on merit - we need people who will help to Make America Great Again! The world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars! Biggest Tax Bill and Tax Cuts in history just passed in the Senate. Now these great Republicans will be going for final passage. Thank you to House and Senate Republicans for your hard work and commitment! From Bush 1 to present our Country has lost more than 55000 factories 6000000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars. Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars. Bad Policies &amp; Leadership. Must WIN again! #MAGA Congratulations to Paul Ryan Kevin McCarthy Kevin Brady Steve Scalise Cathy McMorris Rodgers and all great House Republicans who voted in favor of cutting your taxes! We don‚Äôt want what is happening with immigration in Europe to happen with us! The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states including the smaller ones into play. Campaigning is much different! Where are the 50000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok? Blaming Samsung! Wow! -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch. Warner did not want a ‚Äúpaper trail‚Äù on a ‚Äúprivate‚Äù meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame. All tied into Crooked Hillary. The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration not the Trump Administration. Why didn‚Äôt they do something about it especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September before the Election? ‚ÄúWE‚ÄôRE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT.‚Äù Can you believe this is the Governor of the Highest Taxed State in the U.S. Andrew Cuomo having a total meltdown! As I said today and many times before ‚ÄúI have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people.‚Äù However I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future we cannot exclusively focus on the past ‚Äì as the world‚Äôs two largest nuclear powers we must get along! #HELSINKI2018 Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades. Great level of confidence and optimism - even before tax plan rollout! For many years our country has been divided angry and untrusting. Many say it will never change the hatred is too deep. IT WILL CHANGE!!!! Churches in Texas should be entitled to reimbursement from FEMA Relief Funds for helping victims of Hurricane Harvey (just like others). The United States must at long last be treated fairly on Trade. If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods and they charge us 25 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated. That is not Free or Fair Trade it is Stupid Trade! Had a great meeting at CIA Headquarters yesterday packed house paid great respect to Wall long standing ovations amazing people. WIN! ISIS is on the run &amp; will soon be wiped out of Syria &amp; Iraq illegal border crossings are way down (75%) &amp; MS 13 gangs are being removed. Please understand there are consequences when people cross our Border illegally whether they have children or not - and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes. Congress must act on fixing the DUMBEST &amp; WORST immigration laws anywhere in the world! Vote ‚ÄúR‚Äù is in a total meltdown with their FAKE NEWS because their ratings are tanking since election and their credibility will soon be gone! Deepest condolences to the families &amp; fellow officers of the VA State Police who died today. You're all among the best this nation produces. A year ago the pundits &amp; talking heads people that couldn‚Äôt do the job before were begging for conciliation and peace - ‚Äúplease meet don‚Äôt go to war.‚Äù Now that we meet and have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un the same haters shout out ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt meet do not meet!‚Äù Report: ‚ÄúANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE‚Äù Now it all starts to make sense! Things are going really well for our economy a subject the Fake News spends as little time as possible discussing! Stock Market hit another RECORD HIGH unemployment is now at a 17 year low and companies are coming back into the USA. Really good news and much more to come! The Democrats are delaying my cabinet picks for purely political reasons. They have nothing going but to obstruct. Now have an Obama A.G. James Comey is a proven LEAKER &amp; LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was in fact fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH. He is a weak and..... There hasn‚Äôt been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in North Korea there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages. Who knows how it will all turn out in the end but why isn‚Äôt the Fake News talking about these wonderful facts? Because it is FAKE NEWS! Mexico is doing very little if not NOTHING at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows or I will stop their cash cow NAFTA. NEED WALL! I never said Russia did not meddle in the election I said ‚Äúit may be Russia or China or another country or group or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.‚Äù The Russian ‚Äúhoax‚Äù was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did! Wow the is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena" The NFL National Anthem Debate is alive and well again - can‚Äôt believe it! Isn‚Äôt it in contract that players must stand at attention hand on heart? The $40000000 Commissioner must now make a stand. First time kneeling out for game. Second time kneeling out for season/no pay! After consultation with my Generals and military experts please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow...... If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign that is a really big deal. Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. Drain the Swamp! I have made my decision on who I will nominate for The United States Supreme Court. It will be announced live on Tuesday at 8:00 P.M. (W.H.) Thank you to Brad Blakeman on for grading year one of my presidency with an ‚ÄúA‚Äù-and likewise to Doug Schoen for the very good grade and statements. Working hard! Can you imagine what the outcry would be if failing career and all had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama? Jail time! Despite so many false statements and lies total and complete vindication...and WOW Comey is a leaker! A Rocket has not been launched by North Korea in 9 months. Likewise no Nuclear Tests. Japan is happy all of Asia is happy. But the Fake News is saying without ever asking me (always anonymous sources) that I am angry because it is not going fast enough. Wrong very happy! Highest Stock Market EVER best economic numbers in years unemployment lowest in 17 years wages raising border secure S.C.: No WH chaos! DOJ just issued the McCabe report - which is a total disaster. He LIED! LIED! LIED! McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey!! No collusion all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes! Why didn‚Äôt President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election? Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn‚Äôt want to upset the apple cart! He was in charge not me and did nothing. PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that ‚ÄúUS Tariffs were kind of insulting‚Äù and he ‚Äúwill not be pushed around.‚Äù Very dishonest &amp; weak. Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy! The Fake News is not mentioning the safety and security of our Country when talking about illegal immigration. Our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world and the Dems will do anything not to change them &amp; to obstruct-want open borders which means crime! Twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace. Will that include the Failing New York Times and propaganda machine for Amazon the Washington Post who constantly quote anonymous sources that in my opinion don‚Äôt exist - They will both be out of business in 7 years! Who was it that secretly said to Russian President "Tell Vladimir that after the election I'll have more flexibility?" It wasn‚Äôt the White House it wasn‚Äôt the State Department it wasn‚Äôt father LaVar‚Äôs so-called people on the ground in China that got his son out of a long term prison sentence - IT WAS ME. Too bad! LaVar is just a poor man‚Äôs version of Don King but without the hair. Just think.. The U.S. Coast Guard FEMA and all Federal and State brave people are ready. Here comes Irma. God bless everyone! TO ALL AMERICANS-#HappyNewYear &amp; many blessings to you all! Looking forward to a wonderful &amp; prosperous 2017 as we‚Ä¶ The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers! They will be caught! Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats some big Crooked Hillary supporters and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet there is NO COLLUSION! It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt! A big week especially with our numerous victories in the Supreme Court. Heading back to the White House now. Focus will be on the selection of a new Supreme Court Justice. Exciting times for our country. Economy may be stronger than it has ever been! The Democrats want to abolish ICE which will mean more crime in our country. I want to give ICE a big cheer! Vote Republican in November. Meeting with biggest business leaders this morning. Good jobs are coming back to U.S. health care and tax bills are being crafted NOW! The deal with North Korea is very much in the making and will be if completed a very good one for the World. Time and place to be determined. WITCH HUNT! There was no Russian Collusion. Oh I see there was no Russian Collusion so now they look for obstruction on the no Russian Collusion. The phony Russian Collusion was a made up Hoax. Too bad they didn‚Äôt look at Crooked Hillary like this. Double Standard! It is finally sinking through. 46% OF PEOPLE BELIEVE MAJOR NATIONAL NEWS ORGS FABRICATE STORIES ABOUT ME. FAKE NEWS even worse! Lost cred. MS-13 gang members are being removed by our Great ICE and Border Patrol Agents by the thousands but these killers come back in from El Salvador and through Mexico like water. El Salvador just takes our money and Mexico must help MORE with this problem. We need The Wall! California‚Äôs sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk. Thousands of dangerous &amp; violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies set free to prey on innocent Americans. THIS MUST STOP! Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy something that would be very easy to do and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race? Thank you We would love to have you! Congratulations America we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History...and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction. The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money! No American should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country. Our cities should be Sanctuaries for Americans ‚Äì not for criminal aliens! China just agreed that the U.S. will be allowed to sell beef and other major products into China once again. This is REAL news! The United States will not allow other countries to impose massive Tariffs and Trade Barriers on its farmers workers and companies. While sending their product into our country tax free. We have put up with Trade Abuse for many decades ‚Äî and that is long enough. .....Censorship is a very dangerous thing &amp; absolutely impossible to police. If you are weeding out Fake News there is nothing so Fake as CNN &amp; MSNBC &amp; yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed. I get used to it and watch with a grain of salt or don‚Äôt watch at all.. I will be watching the election results from Trump Tower in Manhattan with my family and friends. Very exciting! The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow. So interesting! I am allowing Japan &amp; South Korea to buy a substantially increased amount of highly sophisticated military equipment from the United States. I call my own shots largely based on an accumulation of data and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media in order to marginalize lies! I have long given the order to help Argentina with the Search and Rescue mission of their missing submarine. 45 people aboard and not much time left. May God be with them and the people of Argentina! Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for ‚Äúpeanuts‚Äù only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO! "It wasn't Donald Trump that divided this country this country has been divided for a long time!" Stated today by Reverend Franklin Graham. ....History shows that a school shooting lasts on average 3 minutes. It takes police &amp; first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained gun adept teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT! I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics. #HELSINKI2018 Sadly Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for DACA. Take care of our Military and our Country FIRST! 4.2 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus and/or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut &amp; Jobs Bill....and it will only get better! We are far ahead of schedule. Remember how badly Iran was behaving with the Iran Deal in place. They were trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary. Now that will not happen! Caught RED HANDED - very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen! Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at but my non-dealings are? The Fake News hates me saying that they are the Enemy of the People only because they know it‚Äôs TRUE. I am providing a great service by explaining this to the American People. They purposely cause great division &amp; distrust. They can also cause War! They are very dangerous &amp; sick! If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance! People who lost money when the Stock Market went down 350 points based on the False and Dishonest reporting of Brian Ross of News (he has been suspended) should consider hiring a lawyer and suing ABC for the damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollars! I don‚Äôt believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA. They are all talk and no action. This is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. Too bad! Governor John Kasich of the GREAT GREAT GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible! Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress the FBI or Justice called for an investigation! Wow CNN had to retract big story on "Russia" with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS! Thank you to all of my great supporters really big progress being made. Other countries wanting to fix crazy trade deals. Economy is ROARING. Supreme Court pick getting GREAT REVIEWS. New Poll says Trump at over 90% is the most popular Republican in history of the Party. Wow! Very important that NFL players STAND tomorrow and always for the playing of our National Anthem. Respect our Flag and our Country! Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston. Police are looking tough and smart! Thank you. Employment is up Taxes are DOWN. Enjoy! I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry. Pricing for the American people will come way down! Jesse Watters ‚ÄúThe only thing Trump obstructed was Hillary getting to the White House.‚Äù So true! The economy of the United States is stronger than ever before! The Democrats just aren‚Äôt calling about DACA. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have to get moving fast or they‚Äôll disappoint you again. We have a great chance to make a deal or blame the Dems! March 5th is coming up fast. Thank you to Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council for his strong statement on that we very badly NEED THE WALL. Must also end loophole of ‚Äúcatch &amp; release‚Äù and clean up the legal and other procedures at the border NOW for Safety &amp; Security reasons. This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown When a country Taxes our products coming in at say 50% and we Tax the same product coming into our country at ZERO not fair or smart. We will soon be starting RECIPROCAL TAXES so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us. $800 Billion Trade Deficit-have no choice! The Fake News Media has been so unfair and vicious to my wife and our great First Lady Melania. During her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death to facelift to left the W.H. (and me) for N.Y. or Virginia to abuse. All Fake she is doing really well! We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country. We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall there is no Deal! If Russia or some other entity was hacking why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost? Well the New Year begins. We will together MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! Wow! Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley who many expected was going to take Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs place just LOST his primary election. In other words he‚Äôs out! That is a big one that nobody saw happening. Perhaps he should have been nicer and more respectful to his President! So many positive things going on for the U.S.A. and the Fake News Media just doesn‚Äôt want to go there. Same negative stories over and over again! No wonder the People no longer trust the media whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history! #MAGA Attending Chief Ryan Owens' Dignified Transfer yesterday with my daughter Ivanka was my great honor. To a great and brave man - thank you! #AMERICA FIRST! Sorry but this is years ago before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary &amp; the Dems the focus????? We finally agree on something Rosie. This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history! An old picture with Nancy and Ronald Reagan. Is it legal for a sitting President to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW! March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Democrats are doing nothing about DACA. They Resist Blame Complain and Obstruct - and do nothing. Start pushing Nancy Pelosi and the Dems to work out a DACA fix NOW! As I made very clear today our country needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border which must be part of any DACA approval. Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal! If we can help little #CharlieGard as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope we would be delighted to do so. Meryl Streep one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes. She is a..... Mitch get back to work and put Repeal &amp; Replace Tax Reform &amp; Cuts and a great Infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing. You can do it! THANK YOU to all of the incredible HEROES in Texas. America is with you! #TexasStrong Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory. The write-in votes played a very big factor but a win is a win. The people of Alabama are great and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends! 'Immigration Ban Is One Of Trump's Most Popular Orders So Far' Just like they don‚Äôt want to solve the DACA problem why didn‚Äôt the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House &amp; Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn‚Äôt want to and now they just talk! Mike Pompeo Director of the CIA will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all! A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!! Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call. We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country. When somebody comes in we must immediately with no Judges or Court Cases bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order. Most children come without parents... MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton cameras blazing.This should not happen! The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border risking thousands of lives in the process. It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans. We must build a Great Wall think Merit and end Lottery &amp; Chain. USA! After years of Comey with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more) running the FBI its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not we will bring it back to greatness. That's right we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries not some politically correct term that won't help us protect our people! Not surprisingly the GREAT Men &amp; Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI. Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI! #SPYGATE DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don‚Äôt really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military. At some point and for the good of the country I predict we will start working with the Democrats in a Bipartisan fashion. Infrastructure would be a perfect place to start. After having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the Middle East it is time to start rebuilding our country! Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction! Senator Mitch McConnell said I had "excessive expectations" but I don't think so. After 7 years of hearing Repeal &amp; Replace why not done? A great day at the White House! The United States will impose large sanctions on Turkey for their long time detainment of Pastor Andrew Brunson a great Christian family man and wonderful human being. He is suffering greatly. This innocent man of faith should be released immediately! I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency the Turkish Lira slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar! Aluminum will now be 20% and Steel 50%. Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time! Feels good to be home after seven months but the White House is very special there is no place like it... and the U.S. is really my home! We must always arrest people coming into our Country illegally. Of the 12000 children 10000 are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip and only 2000 are with their parents many of whom have tried to enter our Country illegally on numerous occasions. You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people! #MAGA I am asking all citizens to believe in yourselves believe in your future and believe once more in America. #AmericaFirstüá∫üá∏ I hereby demand a second investigation after Schumer of Pelosi for her close ties to Russia and lying about it. Don't let the FAKE NEWS tell you that there is big infighting in the Trump Admin. We are getting along great and getting major things done! I am thinking about changing the name #FakeNews CNN to #FraudNewsCNN! Will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I've helped pass and signed 38 Legislative Bills mostly with no Democratic support and gotten rid of massive amounts of regulations. Nice! Remember the most hated part of ObamaCare is the Individual Mandate which is being terminated under our just signed Tax Cut Bill. Fake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories. Ratings way down! Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile.Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them! The European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade. I have an idea for them. Both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs Barriers and Subsidies! That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade! Hope they do it we are ready - but they won‚Äôt! Funny how all of the Pundits that couldn‚Äôt come close to making a deal on North Korea are now all over the place telling me how to make a deal! Sorry I‚Äôve got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear bad Trade Deals VA Choice the Economy rebuilding the Military and so much more and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc. How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe the man in charge along with leakin‚Äô James Comey of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700000 for wife‚Äôs campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation? Marine Plane crash in Mississippi is heartbreaking. Melania and I send our deepest condolences to all! Inauguration Day is turning out to be even bigger than expected. January 20th Washington D.C. Have fun! The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election and so badly (306) so they made up a story - RUSSIA. Fake news! Secretary Pompeo and his ‚Äúguests‚Äù will be landing at Andrews Air Force Base at 2:00 A.M. in the morning. I will be there to greet them. Very exciting! Just out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times and 4 times last year alone. The NFL is now thinking about a new idea - keeping teams in the Locker Room during the National Anthem next season. That‚Äôs almost as bad as kneeling! When will the highly paid Commissioner finally get tough and smart? This issue is killing your league!..... I have tremendous respect for women and the many roles they serve that are vital to the fabric of our society and our economy. The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks! We are building our future with American hands American labor American iron aluminum and steel. Happy #LaborDay! All civilized nations must join together to protect human life and the sacred right of our citizens to live in safety and in peace. I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia they know exactly what they are doing.... My son Donald did a good job last night. He was open transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad! The U.S. economy is looking very good in my opinion even better than anticipated. Companies are pouring back into our country reversing the long term trend of leaving. The unemployment numbers are looking great and Regulations &amp; Taxes have been massively Cut! JOBS JOBS JOBS People are pouring into Washington in record numbers. Bikers for Trump are on their way. It will be a great Thursday Friday and Saturday! Just Out: House Intelligence Committee Report released. ‚ÄúNo evidence‚Äù that the Trump Campaign ‚Äúcolluded coordinated or conspired with Russia.‚Äù Clinton Campaign paid for Opposition Research obtained from Russia- Wow! A total Witch Hunt! MUST END NOW! The jury was not told the killer of Kate was a 7 time felon. The Schumer/Pelosi Democrats are so weak on Crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 Elections. If President Obama (who got nowhere with North Korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed) had gotten along with North Korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that I have the Fake News would have named him a national hero! After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening but only time will tell! "One of the most effective press conferences I've ever seen!" says Rush Limbaugh. Many agree.Yet FAKE MEDIA calls it differently! Dishonest Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on America! Andrew McCarthy - ‚ÄúI said this could never happen. This is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff not just the people who gave it. It is so bad it screams out at you.‚Äù On the whole FISA scam which led to the rigged Mueller Witch Hunt! Here is my statement. Sean Spicer is a wonderful person who took tremendous abuse from the Fake News Media - but his future is bright! Looking more &amp; more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC. Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie. Republicans must get tough now. An illegal Scam! The so-called "A" list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration but look what they did for Hillary NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE! The Fake News is working overtime. Just reported that despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy &amp; all things else 91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake). Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials? Mike Pence won big. We should all be proud of Mike! Uranium deal to Russia with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn't want to follow! Wow more than 90% of Fake News Media coverage of me is negative with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories. Hence my use of Social Media the only way to get the truth out. Much of Mainstream Meadia has become a joke! Crime and killings in Chicago have reached such epidemic proportions that I am sending in Federal help. 1714 shootings in Chicago this year! Melania and I are hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Mrs. Abe at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach Fla. They are a wonderful couple! I will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered. Am also working with Congress on many fronts. Thanks to REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP America is WINNING AGAIN - and America is being RESPECTED again all over the world. Because we are finally putting AMERICA FIRST! Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? Why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europe‚Äôs protection then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY not by 2025. The IG Report totally destroys James Comey and all of his minions including the great lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page who started the disgraceful Witch Hunt against so many innocent people. It will go down as a dark and dangerous period in American History! Fantastic to have 400000 GREAT MEN &amp; WOMEN of Rolling Thunder in D.C. showing their patriotism. They love our Country they love our Flag they stand for our National Anthem! Thanks to Executive Director Artie Muller. Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are! Does the Fake News Media remember when Crooked Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State was begging Russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button? Obama tried also but he had zero chemistry with Putin. Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation for a change! This is why we need more Republicans elected in November. Democrats are good at only three things High Taxes High Crime and Obstruction. Sad! The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion &amp; yet on and on it goes. Russia &amp; the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control! Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself. I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day. Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen! Congratulations to the Washington Capitals on their GREAT play and winning the Stanley Cup Championship. Alex Ovechkin the team captain was spectacular - a true Superstar! D.C. is popping in many ways. What a time! WOW ‚ÄúDossier is bogus. Clinton Campaign DNC funded Dossier. FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION. FBI TAINTED.‚Äù And they used this Crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign! DACA has been made increasingly difficult by the fact that Cryin‚Äô Chuck Schumer took such a beating over the shutdown that he is unable to act on immigration! My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border ending chain migration and canceling the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans. Congratulations to Karen Handel on her big win in Georgia 6th. Fantastic job we are all very proud of you! On this wonderful Veterans Day I want to express the incredible gratitude of the entire American Nation to our GREAT VETERANS. Thank you! I want to thank Steve Bannon for his service. He came to the campaign during my run against Crooked Hillary Clinton - it was great! Thanks S Kim Jong Un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision. The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable! Great briefing this afternoon on the start of our Southern Border WALL! don‚Äôt focus on me focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine! Everyone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA. Disgraceful! Report just out: ‚ÄúChina hacked Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private Email Server.‚Äù Are they sure it wasn‚Äôt Russia (just kidding!)? What are the odds that the FBI and DOJ are right on top of this? Actually a very big story. Much classified information! Democrats who want Open Borders and care little about Crime are incompetent but they have the Fake News Media almost totally on their side! NO COLLUSION - RIGGED WITCH HUNT! NASDAQ has just gone above 8000 for the first time in history! After witnessing first hand the horror &amp; devastation caused by Hurricane Harveymy heart goes out even more so to the great people of Texas! Why is the United States Post Office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE! Very proud of my Executive Order which will allow greatly expanded access and far lower costs for HealthCare. Millions of people benefit! The so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over exaggeration put out by the Fake News Media in order to make us look as bad as possible. With that being said leakers are traitors and cowards and we will find out who they are! The only things the Democrats do well is ‚ÄúResist‚Äù which is their campaign slogan and ‚ÄúObstruct.‚Äù Cryin‚Äô Chuck Schumer has almost 400 great American people that are waiting ‚Äúforever‚Äù to serve our Country! A total disgrace. Mitch M should not let them go home until all approved! The United States does not need John Kerry‚Äôs possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal. He was the one that created this MESS in the first place! Funny to watch the Democrats criticize Trade Deals being negotiated by me when they don‚Äôt even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the Obama Administration did NOTHING on trade except let other countries rip off the United States. Lost almost $800 Billion/year under ‚ÄúO‚Äù If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the U.S. then with all of the Committee Hearings Investigations and Party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America! Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do. The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011 and they decided not to do anything about DACA. They only want to use it as a campaign issue. Vote Republican! The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately only a small number of players decided to come and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry! Senator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting. Deals can‚Äôt get made when there is no trust! Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military. Two dozen NFL players continue to kneel during the National Anthem showing total disrespect to our Flag &amp; Country. No leadership in NFL! The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually in numerous cases planned out by liberal activists. Sad! Our entire Nation w/one heavy heart continues to pray for the victims &amp; their families in Parkland FL. To teachers law enforcement first responders &amp; medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger: We THANK YOU for your courage! There will be NO change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works and it stays! While not at all presidential I must point out that the Sloppy Michael Moore Show on Broadway was a TOTAL BOMB and was forced to close. Sad! I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign. Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT! Yesterday was a big day for the stock market. Jobs are coming back to America. Chrysler is coming back to the USA from Mexico and many others will follow. Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing. American business is hot again! We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER and we must have a great WALL to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country! Toyota &amp; Mazda to build a new $1.6B plant here in the U.S.A. and create 4K new American jobs. A great investment in American manufacturing! We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals. Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry it‚Äôs time for a change! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew because of sources and methods (and more) would have to be heavily redacted whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to re-do and send back in proper form! not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel January 20th is fast approaching! Just won big Supreme Court decision on Voting! Great News! Spoke to U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May today to offer condolences on the terrorist attack in London. She is strong and doing very well. Because of the $700 &amp; $716 Billion Dollars gotten to rebuild our Military many jobs are created and our Military is again rich. Building a great Border Wall with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country is all about National Defense. Build WALL through M! Not looking good for our great Military or Safety &amp; Security on the very dangerous Southern Border. Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts and what they are doing for our booming economy. Remember when you hear the words "sources say" from the Fake Media often times those sources are made up and do not exist. A strong Poland is a blessing to the nations of Europe and a strong Europe is a blessing to the West and to the world. Democrats would do much better as a party if they got together with Republicans on HealthcareTax CutsSecurity. Obstruction doesn't work! We had a great News Conference at Trump Tower today. A couple of FAKE NEWS organizations were there but the people truly get what's going on Thanks you for all of the Trump Rallies today. Amazing support. We will all MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Drain the Swamp should be changed to Drain the Sewer - it's actually much worse than anyone ever thought and it begins with the Fake News! I have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI (although I do not legally have to) because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on. But you do have to ask why the DOJ &amp; FBI aren‚Äôt giving over requested documents? Every day the brave men and women of ICE are liberating communities from savage gangs like MS-13. We will NOT stand for these vile Democrat smears in law enforcement. We will always stand proudly with the BRAVE HEROES of ICE and BORDER PATROL! The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition. Crime in Germany is way up. Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture! I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night - the worst ever. Smartest people of them all are the "DEPLORABLES." So the Democrats make up a phony crime Collusion with the Russians pay a fortune to make the crime sound real illegally leak (Comey) classified information so that a Special Councel will be appointed and then Collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in Fake News! Yes Arnold Schwarzenegger did a really bad job as Governor of California and even worse on the Apprentice...but at least he tried hard! A great American Kurt Cochran was killed in the London terror attack. My prayers and condolences are with his family and friends. Jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the U.S. Unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically Cut and it will only get better. MUCH MORE TO COME! Children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country. Has anyone been looking at the Crime taking place south of the border. It is historic with some countries the most dangerous places in the world. Not going to happen in the U.S. Don't let up keep getting out to vote - this election is FAR FROM OVER! We are doing well but there is much time left. GO FLORIDA! Frank ‚ÄúFX‚Äù Giaccio-On behalf of Melania &amp; myself THANK YOU for doing a GREAT job this morning! gives you an A+! #HappyIndependenceDay #July4 #USAüá∫üá∏ 45000 construction &amp; manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. $20 billion investment. We are already winning again America! So exciting! I have agreed to be the Commencement Speaker at our GREAT Naval Academy on May 25th in Annapolis Maryland. Looking forward to being there. I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide! Public opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the ‚ÄúSpecial‚Äù Counsel because the public understands that there was no Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous) that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation &amp; that the only Collusion was with the Dems! Very much enjoyed my tour of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture...A great job done by amazing people! The Fake News Media works hard at disparaging &amp; demeaning my use of social media because they don't want America to hear the real story! We must have Border Security get rid of Chain Lottery Catch &amp; Release Sanctuary Cities - go to Merit based Immigration. Protect ICE and Law Enforcement and of course keep building but much faster THE WALL! No Collusion and No Obstruction except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats. All of the resignations and corruption yet heavily conflicted Bob Mueller refuses to even look in that direction. What about the Brennan Comey McCabe Strzok lies to Congress or Crooked‚Äôs Emails! I have long heard that the most important decision a U.S. President can make is the selection of a Supreme Court Justice - Will be announced tonight at 9:00 P.M. 19000 RESPECTING our National Anthem! #StandForOurAnthemüá∫üá∏ ....and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all! Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook &amp; even Dems &amp; DNC. Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration right up to January 20th why aren‚Äôt they the subject of the investigation? Why didn‚Äôt Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren‚Äôt Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions! Has anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director? He will go down as easily the WORST in history &amp; since getting out he has become nothing less than a loudmouth partisan political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country! The Senate should get funding done before the August break or NOT GO HOME. Wall and Border Security should be included. Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations worst in history. Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct all they know how to do. STAY! As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out however there was tremendous leaking lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI Justice &amp; State. #DrainTheSwamp I think Senator Blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in Vietnam where he lied about his service so he can at least say he was there We are going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming CR. Illegal immigration must end! Obama Schumer and Pelosi did NOTHING about North Korea and now weak on Crime High Tax Schumer is telling me what to do at the Summit the Dems could never set up. Schumer failed with North Korea and Iran we don‚Äôt need his advice! of jobs and companies lost. If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting. Chrysler is moving a massive plant from Mexico to Michigan reversing a years long opposite trend. Thank you Chrysler a very wise decision. The voters in Michigan are very happy they voted for Trump/Pence. Plenty of more to follow! The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term ‚ÄúMission Accomplished.‚Äù I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term it should be brought back. Use often! ...in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33000 Emails got $145000000 while Secretary of State paid McCabes wife $700000 (and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M) and so much more. Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam. I recently had a terrific meeting with a bipartisan group of freshman lawmakers who feel very strongly in favor of Congressional term limits. I gave them my full support and endorsement for their efforts. #DrainTheSwamp A Rigged System - They don‚Äôt want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal ‚Äújustice?‚Äù At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved! Drudge Report ‚ÄúOBAMA KEPT THEM IN CAGES WRAPPED THEM IN FOIL‚Äù We do a much better job while at the same time maintaining a MUCH stronger Border! Mainstream Fake Media hates this story. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! There is a Revolution going on in California. Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous crime infested &amp; breeding concept. Jerry Brown is trying to back out of the National Guard at the Border but the people of the State are not happy. Want Security &amp; Safety NOW! Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad Wow word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI ‚ÄúSPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT.‚Äù Andrew McCarthy says ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.‚Äù If so this is bigger than Watergate! There is No Collusion! The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt headed now by 17 (increased from 13 including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats was started by a fraudulent Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. Therefore the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam! Congratulations to Rex Tillerson on being sworn in as our new Secretary of State. He will be a star! Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia a made up Scam and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around comes around! On International Women's Day join me in honoring the critical role of women here in America &amp; around the world. I win an election easily a great "movement" is verified and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state! If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics! Congress - FIX OUR INSANE IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW! Many people in our Country are asking what the ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress deleted and ‚Äúacid washed‚Äù 33000 Emails? No justice! The Republican Party is starting to show very big numbers. People are starting to see what is being done. Results are speaking loudly. North Korea and our greatest ever economy are leading the way! is MUCH more important in the United States than CNN but outside of the U.S. CNN International is still a major source of (Fake) news and they represent our Nation to the WORLD very poorly. The outside world does not see the truth from them! Just fired Agent Strzok formerly of the FBI was in charge of the Crooked Hillary Clinton sham investigation. It was a total fraud on the American public and should be properly redone! Never seen such Republican ANGER &amp; UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12000000?).... The OPEC Monopoly must remember that gas prices are up &amp; they are doing little to help. If anything they are driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members for very little $‚Äôs. This must be a two way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW! My thoughts condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack. God and your country are with you! The United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country remove those Barriers &amp; Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the U.S.A. Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street! Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now &amp; work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in! Today there were terror attacks in Turkey Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking! ....and why hasn‚Äôt the Podesta brother been charged and arrested like others after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington D.C.? The Fake News Media is going Crazy! They make up stories without any backup sources or proof. Many of the stories written about me and the good people surrounding me are total fiction. Problem is when you complain you just give them more publicity. But I‚Äôll complain anyway! Taliban targeted innocent Afghans brave police in Kabul today. Our thoughts and prayers go to the victims and first responders. We will not allow the Taliban to win! DOW RISES 5000 POINTS ON THE YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of the brave troops lost in the helicopter crash on the Iraq-Syria border yesterday. Their sacrifice in service to our country will never be forgotten. House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia. As I have been saying all along it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Counsel appointed. Witch Hunt! The Wall Street Journal asks ‚ÄúWHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA?‚Äù A very good question! It‚Äôs March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA. Gave them 6 months they just don‚Äôt care. Where are they? We are ready to make a deal! Happy to announce we are awarding $1M to Las Vegas - in order to help local law enforcement working OT to respond to last Sunday‚Äôs tragedy. Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss. She lost the debates and lost her direction! Today is a day that I‚Äôve been looking very much forward to ALL YEAR LONG. It is one that you have heard me speak about many times before. Now as President of the United States it is my tremendous honor to finally wish America and the world a very MERRY CHRISTMAS! Will the Dems and Fake News ever learn? This is classic! Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all! In any event the United States under my Administration has done a great job of ridding the region of ISIS. Where is our ‚ÄúThank you America?‚Äù The FAKE MSM is working so hard trying to get me not to use Social Media. They hate that I can get the honest and unfiltered message out. Dow hit a new intraday all-time high! I wonder whether or not the Fake News Media will so report? MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded. Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled. Thank you and it will get even (much) better! I hope John Brennan the worst CIA Director in our country‚Äôs history brings a lawsuit. It will then be very easy to get all of his records texts emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt. He won‚Äôt sue! For years and through many administrations everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility. Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity. Look forward to our meeting! Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices. Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration we won‚Äôt let that happen. They are closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT while at the same time doing nothing to others....... ...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced! The booing at the NFL football game last night when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger ‚ÄúJohn Brennan is panicking. He has disgraced himself he has disgraced the Country he has disgraced the entire Intelligence Community. He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of American‚Äôs faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the.... We must remember this truth: No matter our color creed religion or political party we are ALL AMERICANS FIRST. ...to stop drugs they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do.‚Äù My standard is very simple AMERICA FIRST &amp; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea. If they are unable to do so the U.S. with its allies will! U.S.A. ‚ÄúSchool shooting survivor says he quit Town Hall after refusing scripted question.‚Äù Just like so much of CNN Fake News. That‚Äôs why their ratings are so bad! MSNBC may be worse. The debates especially the second and third plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS gave us the win! House Republicans could easily pass a Bill on Strong Border Security but remember it still has to pass in the Senate and for that we need 10 Democrat votes and all they do is RESIST. They want Open Borders and don‚Äôt care about Crime! Need more Republicans to WIN in November! Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems and played up by the media in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks! Great to be in Singapore excitement in the air! Melania and I are honored to light up the this evening for #WorldAutismAwarenessDay. Join us &amp; #LIUB.‚Ä¶ While on FAKE NEWS Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network. They said technical difficulties! Melania our great and very hard working First Lady who truly loves what she is doing always thought that ‚Äúif you run you will win.‚Äù She would tell everyone that ‚Äúno doubt he will win.‚Äù I also felt I would win (or I would not have run) - and Country is doing great! The Democrats are making a strong push to abolish ICE one of the smartest toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that I have ever seen. I have watched ICE liberate towns from the grasp of MS-13 &amp; clean out the toughest of situations. They are great! Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans &amp; Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8 but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer! Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: "In my opinion it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity." So true! And the FAKE NEWS winners I will be going to Texas as soon as that trip can be made without causing disruption. The focus must be life and safety. Despite the phony Witch Hunt going on in America the economic &amp; jobs numbers are great. Regulations way down jobs and enthusiasm way up! Thank you for a wonderful evening in Washington D.C. #Inauguration Pfizer &amp; others should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason. They are merely taking advantage of the poor &amp; others unable to defend themselves while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in Europe &amp; elsewhere. We will respond! Thank you to all of the supporters who far out-numbered the protesters yesterday at the Women's U.S. Open. Very cool! In the ‚Äúold days‚Äù when good news was reported the Stock Market would go up. Today when good news is reported the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake and we have so much good (great) news about the economy! Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G) then based his decisions on her poll numbers. Disgruntled he McCabe and the others committed many crimes! Miami-Dade Mayor drops sanctuary policy. Right decision. Strong! Congratulations to Republican Debbie Lesko on her big win in the Special Election for Arizona House seat. Debbie will do a Great Job! Press is so silent. Homeland Security and law enforcement are on alert &amp; closely watching for any sign of trouble. Our borders are far tougher than ever before! Oil prices are too high OPEC is at it again. Not good! Please do not forget the great help that my good friend President Xi of China has given to the United States particularly at the Border of North Korea. Without him it would have been a much longer tougher process! Despite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage there are many great reporters I respect and lots of GOOD NEWS for the American people to be proud of! 45 year low on illegal border crossings this year. Ice and Border Patrol Agents are doing a great job for our Country. MS-13 thugs being hit hard. A total disgrace that Turkey will not release a respected U.S. Pastor Andrew Brunson from prison. He has been held hostage far too long. should do something to free this wonderful Christian husband &amp; father. He has done nothing wrong and his family needs him! ‚ÄúMainstream Media tries to rewrite history to credit Obama for Trump accomplishments. Since President Trump took office the economy is booming. The stronger the economy gets the more desperate his critics are. O had weakest recovery since Great Depression.‚Äù ....The Wall will be paid for directly or indirectly or through longer term reimbursement by Mexico which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. The $20 billion dollar Wall is ‚Äúpeanuts‚Äù compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke! A big deal looking good with Mexico! Many Democrats are deeply concerned about the fact that their ‚Äúleadership‚Äù wants to denounce and abandon the great men and women of ICE thereby declaring war on Law &amp; Order. These people will be voting for Republicans in November and in many cases joining the Republican Party! ‚ÄúPresident Trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy. Tax Cut bonuses to more than 2000000 workers. Most explosive Stock Market rally that we‚Äôve seen in modern times. 18000 to 26000 from Election and grounded in profitability and growth. All Trump not 0... Honored to serve as Commander-in-Chief to the courageous men and women of our U.S. Armed Forces. A grateful nation thanks you! Heading back from a very exciting two days in Davos Switzerland. Speech on America‚Äôs economic revival was well received. Many of the people I met will be investing in the U.S.A.! #MAGA REST IN PEACE BILLY GRAHAM! Jenna Ellis ‚ÄúFBI thought they wouldn‚Äôt get caught because they thought that Hillary was going to win. There is overt bias and that depends on whether you are Democrat or Republican - a double standard that needs to stop.‚Äù Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today and best regards to all of those injured in Charlottesville Virginia. So sad! So they caught Fake News CNN cold but what about NBC CBS &amp; ABC? What about the failing &amp; They are all Fake News! James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal! Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country.#StandForOurAnthemüá∫üá∏ My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on concerning immigrants &amp; Sweden. ESPN is paying a really big price for its politics (and bad programming). People are dumping it in RECORD numbers. Apologize for untruth! Iran‚Äôs Military Budget is up more than 40% since the Obama negotiated Nuclear Deal was reached...just another indicator that it was all a big lie. But not anymore! Mark Penn ‚ÄúWhy are there people from the Clinton Foundation on the Mueller Staff? Why is there an Independent Counsel? To go after people and their families for unrelated offenses...Constitution was set up to prevent this...Stormtrooper tactics almost.‚Äù A disgrace! Somebody with aptitude and conviction should buy the FAKE NEWS and failing and either run it correctly or let it fold with dignity! Do you notice the Fake News Mainstream Media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative. The Russian Collusion Hoax is dead except as it pertains to the Dems. Public gets it! I want to thank Chairman Kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people. Our unprecedented meeting ‚Äì the first between an American President and a leader of North Korea ‚Äì proves that real change is possible! I will be announcing my decision on the Iran Deal tomorrow from the White House at 2:00pm. Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting. The Massive Tax Cuts which the Fake News Media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their Democrat bosses will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves. Companies are already making big payments to workers. Dems want to raise taxes hate these big Cuts! Congratulations Secretary Mattis! The sleazy New York Democrats and their now disgraced (and run out of town) A.G. Eric Schneiderman are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in $18800000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in $19200000. I won‚Äôt settle this case!... Things will work out fine between the U.S.A. and Russia. At the right time everyone will come to their senses &amp; there will be lasting peace! The Democrats have no message not on economics not on taxes not on jobs not on failing #Obamacare. They are only OBSTRUCTIONISTS! For every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council I have many to take their place. Grandstanders should not have gone on. JOBS! Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails. Congratulations to Eric &amp; Lara on the birth of their son Eric "Luke" Trump this morning! The NFL players are at it again - taking a knee when they should be standing proudly for the National Anthem. Numerous players from different teams wanted to show their ‚Äúoutrage‚Äù at something that most of them are unable to define. They make a fortune doing what they love...... The Tax Cut/Reform Bill including Massive Alaska Drilling and the Repeal of the highly unpopular Individual Mandate brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had. Don‚Äôt let the Fake News convince you otherwise...and our insider Polls are strong! My Administration stands in solidarity with the brave citizens in Orange County defending their rights against California's illegal and unconstitutional Sanctuary policies. California's Sanctuary laws.... The Stock Market hit 25000 yesterday. Jobs are at an all time record - and that is before we fix some of the worst trade deals and conditions ever seen by any government. It is all happening! Despite what you hear in the press healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture! After 200 days rarely has any Administration achieved what we have achieved..not even close! Don't believe the Fake News Suppression Polls! The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc? The U.S. has been talking to North Korea and paying them extortion money for 25 years. Talking is not the answer! The dishonest media will NEVER keep us from accomplishing our objectives on behalf of our GREAT AMERICAN PEOPLE!‚Ä¶ To every PATRIOT who will serve on the #USSGeraldRFord:‚òëÔ∏èKeep the watchüá∫üá∏‚òëÔ∏èProtect herüá∫üá∏‚òëÔ∏èDefend herüá∫üá∏‚òëÔ∏èLOVE HERüá∫üá∏Good Luck &amp; Godspeed! On behalf of a GRATEFUL NATION THANK YOU to all of the First Responders (HEROES) who saved countless lives in Las Vegas on Sunday night. The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you! Because Jobs in the U.S. are doing so well Americans receiving unemployment aid is the lowest since 1973. Great! In NYC looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.! We are bringing back our factories we are bringing back our jobs and we are bringing back those four beautiful words: MADE IN THE USA! A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest! Government Funding Bill past last night in the House of Representatives. Now Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders. Shutdown coming? We need more Republican victories in 2018! Numerous states are refusing to give information to the very distinguished VOTER FRAUD PANEL. What are they trying to hide? Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice! For years even as a "civilian" I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance! Honor of a lifetime to meet His Holiness Pope Francis. I leave the Vatican more determined than ever to pursue PEAC‚Ä¶ Without more Republicans in Congress we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally after many years of depletion take care of our Military. Sadly we needed some Dem votes for passage. Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election! The Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda. Any Immigration Bill MUST HAVE full funding for the Wall end Catch &amp; Release Visa Lottery and Chain and go to Merit Based Immigration. Go for it! WIN! Great day for America's future Security and Safety courtesy of the U.S. Supreme Court. I will keep fighting for the American people &amp; WIN! Report out that Obama Campaign paid $972000 to Fusion GPS. The firm also got $12400000 (really?) from DNC. Nobody knows who OK'd! Congratulations to two great and hardworking guys Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie on the success of their just out book ‚ÄúLet Trump Be Trump.‚Äù Finally people with real knowledge are writing about our wonderful and exciting campaign! ‚ÄúDepartment of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.‚Äù Jeff this is GREAT what everyone wants so look into all of the corruption on the ‚Äúother side‚Äù including deleted Emails Comey lies &amp; leaks Mueller conflicts McCabe Strzok Page Ohr...... So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were ‚Äúleaked‚Äù to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh I see...you have a made up phony crime Collusion that never existed and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice! Nancy Pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big Tax Cuts given to the American People by the Republicans...got not one Democrat Vote! Here‚Äôs a choice. They want to end them and raise your taxes substantially. Republicans are working on making them permanent and more cuts! Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years! After 7 months of investigations &amp; committee hearings about my "collusion with the Russians" nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad! After many years of failurecountries are coming together to finally address the dangers posed by North Korea. We must be tough &amp; decisive! The Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don‚Äôt exist). They are totally unhinged and the great success of this Administration is making them do and say things that even they can‚Äôt believe they are saying. Truly bad people! As long as we open our eyes to God‚Äôs grace - and open our hearts to God‚Äôs love - then America will forever be the land of the free the home of the brave and a light unto all nations. #NationalPrayerBreakfast I am sorry to have to reiterate that there are serious and unpleasant consequences to crossing the Border into the United States ILLEGALLY! If there were no serious consequences our country would be overrun with people trying to get in and our system could not handle it! TEXAS: We are with you today we are with you tomorrow and we will be with you EVERY SINGLE DAY AFTER to restore recover and REBUILD! Another attack in London by a loser terrorist.These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive! Based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate has been terminated as part of our Tax Cut Bill which essentially Repeals (over time) ObamaCare the Democrats &amp; Republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new HealthCare plan! ....countries which are doing badly. I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. I want safety and security for our people. I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. I want to fund our military not do a Dem defund.... Venezuela should allow Leopoldo Lopez a political prisoner &amp; husband of (just met w/ o‚Ä¶ Prime Minister Trudeau is being so indignant bringing up the relationship that the U.S. and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things...but he doesn‚Äôt bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy ‚Äî hurting our Farmers killing our Agriculture! MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Clapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign. Large dollars were paid to the Spy far beyond normal. Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history. SPYGATE - a terrible thing! The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact! How can ‚ÄúSenator‚Äù Richard Blumenthal who went around for twenty years as a Connecticut politician bragging that he was a great Marine war hero in Vietnam (then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a Marine nor ever in Vietnam) pass judgement on anyone? Loser! Wacky Congresswoman Wilson is the gift that keeps on giving for the Republican Party a disaster for Dems. You watch her in action &amp; vote R! The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait ‚Äòtill the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest! Watching Hurricane closely. My team which has done and is doing such a good job in Texas is already in Florida. No rest for the weary! My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media &amp; authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (&amp; acid washed) her 33000 e-mails! ‚ÄúI‚Äôd strip the whole bunch of them. They‚Äôre all corrupt. They‚Äôve all abused their power. They‚Äôve all betrayed the American people with a political agenda. They tried to steal and influence an election in the United States.‚Äù Democrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base. They don‚Äôt want to do it but are powerless! Beginning today the United States of America gets back control of its borders. Full speech from today After reading the false reporting and even ferocious anger in some dying magazines it makes me wonder WHY? All I want to do is #MAGA! ...to win. The Democrats are overplaying their hand. They lost the election and now they have lost their grip on reality. The real story... Looking forward to greeting the Hostages (no longer) at 2:00 A.M. Today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another or from one party to another ‚Äì but we are transferring... Ford said last week that it will expand in Michigan and U.S. instead of building a BILLION dollar plant in Mexico. Thank you Ford &amp; Fiat C!

Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene. Very good meetings with North Korea. HISTORIC rainfall in Houston and all over Texas. Floods are unprecedented and more rain coming. Spirit of the people is incredible.Thanks! So General Michael Flynn‚Äôs life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don‚Äôt think so! ‚ÄúThe most profound question of our era: Was there a conspiracy in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President of the U.S. and was Strzok at the core of the conspiracy?‚Äù Judge Andrew Napolitano The Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military. It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great. Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill! Why don‚Äôt the Democrats give us the votes to fix the world‚Äôs worst immigration laws? Where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs including MS-13 coming into our country illegally? Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border rest will be forthcoming. Most importantly got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military $716 Billion next year...most ever. Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment. A beautiful funeral today for a real NYC hero Detective Steven McDonald. Our law enforcement community has my complete and total support. A photo delivered yesterday that will be displayed in the upper/lower press hall. Thank you Abbas! The failing has been wrong about me from the very beginning. Said I would lose the primaries then the general election. FAKE NEWS! Democrats are the problem. They don‚Äôt care about crime and want illegal immigrants no matter how bad they may be to pour into and infest our Country like MS-13. They can‚Äôt win on their terrible policies so they view them as potential voters! Big announcement by Ford today. Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants. Car companies coming back to U.S. JOBS! JOBS! JOBS! For first time the failing will take an ad (a bad one) to help save its failing reputation. Try reporting accurately &amp; fairly! The trip by Pence was long planned. He is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country! Today it was my great honor to proclaim January 15 2018 as Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic community and service activities in honor of Dr. King's life and legacy. Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate? ‚ÄúThe FBI only looked at 3000 of 675000 Crooked Hillary Clinton Emails.‚Äù They purposely didn‚Äôt look at the disasters. This news is just out. Just out report: "United Kingdom crime rises 13% annually amid spread of Radical Islamic terror." Not good we must keep America safe! We must maintain a Strong Southern Border. We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief hoping it will help them in the elections. Obama and others had the same pictures and did nothing about it! Great evening last night in Washington Michigan. The enthusiasm knowledge and love in that room was unreal. To the many thousands of people who couldn‚Äôt get in I cherish you....and will be back! What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad! Is this a first never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? Too bad! The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister! Join me live for the What ever happened to the Server at the center of so much Corruption that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI? They broke into homes &amp; offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the Server? Wow! The NSA has deleted 685 million phone calls and text messages. Privacy violations? They blame technical irregularities. Such a disgrace. The Witch Hunt continues! My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee. I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact. If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her motheras her mother gave our country away the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES! There was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup &amp; trap). What there is is Negotiations going on with North Korea over Nuclear War Negotiations going on with China over Trade Deficits Negotiations on NAFTA and much more. Witch Hunt! Working hard to get the Olympics for the United States (L.A.). Stay tuned! FAKE NEWS media knowingly doesn't tell the truth. A great danger to our country. The failing has become a joke. Likewise Sad! Tremendous pressure is building like never before for the Border Wall and an end to crime cradling Sanctuary Cities. Started the Wall in San Diego where the people were pushing really hard to get it. They will soon be protected! Finally Liddle‚Äô Adam Schiff the leakin‚Äô monster of no control is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President knew of the threat and did nothing. Thank you Adam! The Economy is stronger and better than ever before. Importantly there remains tremendous potential - it will only get better with time! Just left West Palm Beach Fire &amp; Rescue #2.

Retail sales are at record numbers. We‚Äôve got the economy going better than anyone ever dreamt - and you haven‚Äôt seen anything yet! Did Hillary Clinton ever apologize for receiving the answers to the debate? Just asking! Big protests in Iran.

The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations! The White House Correspondents‚Äô Dinner is DEAD as we know it. This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for. FAKE NEWS is alive and well and beautifully represented on Saturday night! Sorry folks but if I would have relied on the Fake News of CNN NBC ABC CBS washpost or nytimes I would have had ZERO chance winning WH Great success today at NATO! Billions of additional dollars paid by members since my election. Great spirit! Getting ready for my big foreign trip. Will be strongly protecting American interests - that's what I like to do! Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to "leak" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? Seven people shot and killed yesterday in Chicago. What is going on there - totally out of control. Chicago needs help! Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory! An honor having the National Sheriffs' Assoc. join me at the Incredible men &amp; women who protect &amp; serv‚Ä¶ It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts. With 3.5 million Americans receiving bonuses or other benefits from their employers as a result of TAX CUTS 2018 is off to great start!‚úÖUnemployment rate at 4.1%.‚úÖAverage earnings up 2.9% in the last year.‚úÖ200000 new American jobs.‚úÖ#MAGAüá∫üá∏ Continuing to monitor the heartbreaking bridge collapse at FIU - so tragic. Many brave First Responders rushed in to save lives. Thank you for your courage. Praying this evening for all who are affected. Just talked with Pfizer CEO and on our drug pricing blueprint. Pfizer is rolling back price hikes so American patients don‚Äôt pay more. We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same. Great news for the American people! I don‚Äôt care what the political ramifications are our immigration laws and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades and there is no way that the Democrats will allow it to be fixed without a Government Shutdown... Playing golf with Prime Minister Abe and Hideki Matsuyama two wonderful people! On Holocaust Remembrance Day we mourn and grieve the murder of 6 million innocent Jewish men women and children and the millions of others who perished in the evil Nazi Genocide. We pledge with all of our might and resolve: Never Again! Congratulations to News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia Russia Russia Witch Hunt. More Networks and ‚Äúpapers‚Äù should do the same with their Fake News! The United States will be immediately implementing much tougher Extreme Vetting Procedures. The safety of our citizens comes first! We are sealing up our Southern Border. The people of our great country want Safety and Security. The Dems have been a disaster on this very important issue! Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja Mexico to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.

Taxes will become Reciprocal &amp; a deal will be made on Intellectual Property. Great future for both countries! Is everybody believing what is going on. James Comey can‚Äôt define what a leak is. He illegally leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION but doesn‚Äôt understand what he did or how serious it is. He lied all over the place to cover it up. He‚Äôs either very sick or very dumb. Remember sailor! I am on Air Force One flying to NATO and hear reports that the FBI lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are getting cold feet on testifying about the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by 13 Angry Democrats and people that worked for Obama for 8 years. Total disgrace! ISIS is taking credit for the terrible stabbing attack at Ohio State University by a Somali refugee who should not have been in our country. Thank you to for exposing the truth. Perhaps that‚Äôs why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition! Fascinating to watch people writing books and major articles about me and yet they know nothing about me &amp; have zero access. #FAKE NEWS! While I know it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot presidential‚Äù to take on a lowlife like Omarosa and while I would rather not be doing so this is a modern day form of communication and I know the Fake News Media will be working overtime to make even Wacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible. Sorry! My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before.... Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years giving billions of dollars &amp; getting nothing. Policy didn't work! Congratulations to a future STAR of the Republican Party future Senator John James. A big and bold victory tonight in the Great State of Michigan - the first of many. November can‚Äôt come fast enough! With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign &amp; Obama Administration there was never a special counsel appointed! For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o'clock in the morning at least you know I will be there awake to answer the call! Jeb Bush George W and George H.W. all called to express their best wishes on the win. Very nice! Writing my inaugural address at the Winter White House Mar-a-Lago three weeks ago. Looking forward to Friday.‚Ä¶ The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain &amp; Lindsey Graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration. The two...

I will be making my choice for Justice of the United States Supreme Court on the first Monday after the July 4th Holiday July 9th! Stock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22000 today. Was 18000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions! Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie! The White House Correspondents‚Äô Dinner was a failure last year but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it. The filthy ‚Äúcomedian‚Äù totally bombed (couldn‚Äôt even deliver her lines-much like the Seth Meyers weak performance). Put Dinner to rest or start over! even those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results we will strengthen up voting procedures! I am thrilled to nominate Dr. as our next Secretary of the US Dept. of Housing and Urban Development‚Ä¶ Negotiations on DACA have begun. Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if we could finally after so many years solve the DACA puzzle. This will be our last chance there will never be another opportunity! March 5th. Our founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence. Our currency declares ‚ÄúIN GOD WE TRUST.‚Äù And we place our hands on our hearts as we recite the Pledge of Allegiance and proclaim that we are ‚ÄúOne Nation Under God.‚Äù #NationalPrayerBreakfast Such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours. Actually we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama. Fake News is working overtime! General John Kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our FLAG or GREAT COUNTRY! Senator Cryin‚Äô Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal even going at it with President Obama &amp; then Voted AGAINST it! Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn‚Äôt really believe that! Same with Comey. Thought he was terrible until I fired him!

Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads bridges tunnels railways (and more) crumble! Not for long! ‚ÄúSeems like the Department of Justice (and FBI) had a program to keep Donald Trump from becoming President‚Äù. If this had happened to the other side everybody involved would be in jail. This is a Media coverup of the biggest story of our time. As everybody is aware the past Administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean Labor camp but to no avail. Stay tuned! U.S. Stock Market up almost 20% since Election! The U.S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico. It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers... ....Too many voices are being destroyed some good &amp; some bad and that cannot be allowed to happen.

Steve Bannon will be a tough and smart new voice at even better than ever before. Fake News needs the competition! If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon! Unbelievably James Comey states that Polls where Crooked Hillary was leading were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job. Slimeball! ....If a potential ‚Äúsicko shooter‚Äù knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won‚Äôt go there...problem solved. Must be offensive defense alone won‚Äôt work! Why didn‚Äôt the 13 Angry Democrats investigate the campaign of Crooked Hillary Clinton many crimes much Collusion with Russia? Why didn‚Äôt the FBI take the Server from the DNC? Rigged Investigation! We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S. but....... The travel ban into the United States should be far larger tougher and more specific-but stupidly that would not be politically correct! Supreme Court rules in favor of non-union workers who are now as an example able to support a candidate of his or her choice without having those who control the Union deciding for them. Big loss for the coffers of the Democrats! The same people who did the phony election polls and were so wrong are now doing approval rating polls. They are rigged just like before. Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't voluntarily leaving the Apprentice he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings not by me.

Very thankful for President Xi of China‚Äôs kind words on tariffs and automobile barriers...also his enlightenment on intellectual property and technology transfers. We will make great progress together! James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council?

Fantastic numbers on consumer spending released on Friday. Stock Market hits all time high! Big dinner with Governors tonight at White House. Much to be discussed including healthcare. Funny how the Fake News Media doesn‚Äôt want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014 long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn‚Äôt know! According to the a Russian sold phony secrets on ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù to the U.S. Asking price was $10 million brought down to $1 million to be paid over time. I hope people are now seeing &amp; understanding what is going on here. It is all now starting to come out - DRAIN THE SWAMP! The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly - I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN! #MAGA So many people are asking why isn't the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33000 e-mails deleted? Just landed - a long trip but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office. There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea. Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience. North Korea has great potential for the future! Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a "moment of courage." Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived. 116% increase! ...dwindling subscribers and readers.They got me wrong right from the beginning and still have not changed course and never will. DISHONEST Washington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing OUR OWN infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair. No more! It's time to REBUILD and we will do it with American WORKERS American GRIT and American PRIDE! I will always remember the time I spent today with courageous students teachers and families. So much love in the midst of so much pain. We must not let them down. We must keep our children safe!!Full Listening Session: We shouldn‚Äôt be hiring judges by the thousands as our ridiculous immigration laws demand we should be changing our laws building the Wall hire Border Agents and Ice and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password. Attorney‚Äìclient privilege is dead! Back from Miami where my Cuban/American friends are very happy with what I signed today. Another campaign promise that I did not forget! Great to be back on track with the European Union. This was a big day for free and fair trade! Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal. According to a Canada release they make almost 100 Billion Dollars in Trade with U.S. (guess they were bragging and got caught!). Minimum is 17B. Tax Dairy from us at 270%. Then Justin acts hurt when called out! ....And add to that the fact that the U.S. pays close to the entire cost of NATO-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on Trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh!). The European Union had a $151 Billion Surplus-should pay much more for Military! It is about time that Roger Goodell of the NFL is finally demanding that all players STAND for our great National Anthem-RESPECT OUR COUNTRY THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA IS THE OPPOSITION PARTY. It is very bad for our Great Country....BUT WE ARE WINNING! The Russia hoax continues now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary? The WALL which is already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls will continue to be built. Meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly....but in the end that doesn‚Äôt matter. We will all know soon whether or not a real deal unlike those of the past can happen! The final Wisconsin vote is in and guess what - we just picked up an additional 131 votes. The Dems and Green Party can now rest. Scam! .....Will the FBI ever recover it‚Äôs once stellar reputation so badly damaged by Comey McCabe Peter S and his lover the lovely Lisa Page and other top officials now dismissed or fired? So many of the great men and women of the FBI have been hurt by these clowns and losers! The Remains of American Servicemen will soon be leaving North Korea and heading to the United States! After so many years this will be a great moment for so many families. Thank you to Kim Jong Un. I‚Äôm very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely don‚Äôt want Trump! America's men &amp; women in uniform is the story of FREEDOM overcoming OPPRESSION the STRONG protecting the WEAK &amp; G‚Ä¶ The Democrats are not doing what‚Äôs right for our country. I will not rest until we have secured our borders and restored the rule of law! My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken. Democrats want open Borders where anyone can come into our Country and stay. This is Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs dream. It won‚Äôt happen! The cast and producers of Hamilton which I hear is highly overrated should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior Trade talks going on with numerous countries that for many years have not treated the United States fairly. In the end all will be happy! BORDER WALL prototypes underway! Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance it‚Äôs worth great prestige and big dollars even board seats and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan. It certainly isn‚Äôt because of the good job he did! He is a political ‚Äúhack.‚Äù Congress get ready to do your job - DACA! Chicago Police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won‚Äôt let them do their job. The killings are at a record pace and tough police work which Chicago will not allow would bring things back to order fast...the killings must stop! üá∫üá∏üá¨üáß The new Rasmussen Poll one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating.That's higher than O's #'s! Our military is building and is rapidly becoming stronger than ever before. Frankly we have no choice! The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. &amp; are unwatchable. is great! Great to be in Riyadh Saudi Arabia. Looking forward to the afternoon and evening ahead. #POTUSAbroad The Democrats are all talk and no action. They are doing nothing to fix DACA. Great opportunity missed. Too bad! Senate passed the VA Accountability Act. The House should get this bill to my desk ASAP! We can‚Äôt tolerate substandard care for our vets. It is a "miracle" how fast the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police were able to find the demented shooter and stop him from even more killing! 95% of Americans will pay less or at worst the same amount of taxes (mostly far less). The Dems only want to raise your taxes! Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now the Rigged Witch Hunt! Why aren't the same standards placed on the Democrats. Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with. Disgraceful! ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry! The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT! Storm turned Hurricane is getting much bigger and more powerful than projected. Federal Government is on site and ready to respond. Be safe! ...Why aren‚Äôt Mueller and the 17 Angry Democrats looking at the meetings concerning the Fake Dossier and all of the lying that went on in the FBI and DOJ? This is the most one sided Witch Hunt in the history of our country. Fortunately the facts are all coming out and fast! Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama‚Äôs term showing children from the Border in steel cages. They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad but backfires. Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country...Bipartisan Bill! Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI &amp; Justice Dept. We must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON‚ÄôT HAVE STEEL YOU DON‚ÄôT HAVE A COUNTRY! When you hear the Fake News talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin and all that I gave up remember I gave up NOTHING we merely talked about future benefits for both countries. Also we got along very well which is a good thing except for the Corrupt Media! I look forward to working w/ D's + R's in Congress to address immigration reform in a way that puts hardworking citizens of our country 1st. ....FISA abuse Christopher Steele &amp; his phony and corrupt Dossier the Clinton Foundation illegal surveillance of Trump Campaign Russian collusion by Dems - and so much more. Open up the papers &amp; documents without redaction? Come on Jeff you can do it the country is waiting! It is outrageous that Poisonous Synthetic Heroin Fentanyl comes pouring into the U.S. Postal System from China. We can and must END THIS NOW! The Senate should pass the STOP ACT ‚Äì and firmly STOP this poison from killing our children and destroying our country. No more delay! Great optimism for future of U.S. business AND JOBS with the DOW having an 11th straight record close. Big tax &amp; regulation cuts coming! Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.! Just out: The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY? After many years of LEAKS going on in Washington it is great to see the A.G. taking action! For National Security the tougher the better! Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free fair and SMART TRADE! Despite the Democrat inspired laws on Sanctuary Cities and the Border being so bad and one sided I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country. It is a disgrace. We are the only Country in the World so naive! WALL Big decision will soon be made on our next Justice of the Supreme Court! I am on my way to Singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for North Korea and the World. It will certainly be an exciting day and I know that Kim Jong-un will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before... The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA! We are making great progress with healthcare. ObamaCare is imploding and will only get worse. Republicans coming together to get job done! AMERICA will once again be a NATION that thinks big dreams bigger and always reaches for the stars. YOU are the ones who will shape America‚Äôs destiny. YOU are the ones who will restore our prosperity. And YOU are the ones who are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #MAGA Received message last night from XI JINPING of China that his meeting with KIM JONG UN went very well and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me. In the meantime and unfortunately maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost! With Mexico being one of the highest crime Nations in the world we must have THE WALL. Mexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other. The U.S. together with Mexico and Canada just got the World Cup. Congratulations - a great deal of hard work! ....Where is the DNC Server and why didn‚Äôt the FBI take possession of it? Deep State? On behalf of an entire Nation CONGRATULATIONS to the U.S. Women's Hockey Team on winning the GOLD! #GoTeamUSA #Olympics Will be signing the biggest ever Tax Cut and Reform Bill in 30 minutes in Oval Office. Will also be signing a much needed 4 billion dollar missile defense bill. 39% of my nominations including Diplomats to foreign lands have not been confirmed due to Democrat obstruction and delay. At this rate it would take more than 7 years before I am allowed to have these great people start working. Never happened before. Disgraceful! Getting ready to deliver a VERY IMPORTANT DECISION! 8:00 P.M. ...are now fighting back like never before. There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton and now the facts are pouring out. DO SOMETHING! The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime WEAK on the Border Bad for our Military and our great Vets Bad for our 2nd Amendment AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY. Jones would be a disaster! It is now commonly agreed after many months of COSTLY looking that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC! Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past. I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices and even homes are going to be raided with everything including their phones and computers taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned! Despite the long delays by the Democrats in finally approving Dr. Tom Price the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare is moving fast! Congratulations Stephen Miller- on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows. Great job! We save a fortune by not doing war games as long as we are negotiating in good faith - which both sides are! Charles Koch of Koch Brothers who claims to be giving away millions of dollars to politicians even though I know very few who have seen this (?) now makes the ridiculous statement that what President Trump is doing is unfair to ‚Äúforeign workers.‚Äù He is correct AMERICA FIRST! Very proud of our incredible First Lady She is a truly great representative for our country! 3.4 million jobs created since our great Election Victory - far greater than ever anticipated and only getting better as new and greatly improved Trade Deals start coming to fruition! Will be calling the President of Egypt in a short while to discuss the tragic terrorist attack with so much loss of life. We have to get TOUGHER AND SMARTER than ever before and we will. Need the WALL need the BAN! God bless the people of Egypt. After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election the FAKE NEWS is still lost! Crooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did. Facebook was on her side not mine! Does anybody really believe that a reporter who nobody ever heard of "went to his mailbox" and found my tax returns? FAKE NEWS! I told Rex Tillerson our wonderful Secretary of State that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man... Our Justice Department must not let Awan &amp; Debbie Wasserman Schultz off the hook. The Democrat I.T. scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today. They want to make a ‚Äúplea deal‚Äù to hide what is on their Server. Where is Server? Really bad! Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent. That's politics! Mark Levin ‚ÄúWhen they had power they didn‚Äôt stop the Russians the Chinese the North Koreans they funded the Iranians &amp; are responsible for the greatest scandal in American history by interfering with our election &amp; trying to undermine the Trump Campaign and Trump Presidency.‚Äù We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration no more Democrat Lottery Systems. We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter). Wow highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. There must be something wrong please recheck that poll! California finally deserves a great Governor one who understands borders crime and lowering taxes. John Cox is the man - he‚Äôll be the best Governor you‚Äôve ever had. I fully endorse John Cox for Governor and look forward to working with him to Make California Great Again! I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go! update and policy plans for the first 100 days. When you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation it will only take longer to make a deal and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity. Negotiations are going really well be cool. The end result will be worth it! Thank you very much working hard! I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His ‚Äúmemos‚Äù are self serving and FAKE! Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea and they have given up nothing. Wow we haven‚Äôt given up anything &amp; they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World) site closure &amp; no more testing! On behalf of an entire nation Happy 242nd Birthday to the men and women of the United States Marines!#USMC242 #SemperFi James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue? Jeff Sessions is an honest man. He did not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately but it was clearly not.... The Obama Administration is now accused of trying to give Iran secret access to the financial system of the United States. This is totally illegal. Perhaps we could get the 13 Angry Democrats to divert some of their energy to this ‚Äúmatter‚Äù (as Comey would call it). Investigate! Received many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations both present &amp; future. We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media. NATO is now strong &amp; rich! The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun. I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something and especially since this is for the American People! The Fake News Media is going CRAZY! They are totally unhinged and in many ways after witnessing first hand the damage they do to so many innocent and decent people I enjoy watching. In 7 years when I am no longer in office their ratings will dry up and they will be gone! Wow watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked ‚Äúhave you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?‚Äù He said strongly ‚Äúnever no.‚Äù He lied as shown clearly on Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try! Our Country is doing GREAT. Best financial numbers on the Planet. Great to have USA WINNING AGAIN! My great friends from NASCAR are having their big race today The Daytona 500. Brian France and the France family are special people. Enjoy the race! ‚ÄúThe FBI looked at less than 1%‚Äù of Crooked‚Äôs Emails! Best wishes to Prime Minister and all of the people of Israel on the 70th Anniversary of your Great Independence. We have no better friends anywhere. Looking forward to moving our Embassy to Jerusalem next month! House of Representatives needs to pass Government Funding Bill tonight. So important for our country - our Military needs it! ....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A ‚Äúgun free‚Äù school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END! The MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN agenda is doing very well despite the distraction of the Witch Hunt. Many new jobs high business enthusiasm.. Comey throws AG Lynch ‚Äúunder the bus!‚Äù Why can‚Äôt we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat or AG in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)! If Obama worked as hard on straightening out our country as he has trying to protect and elect Hillary we would all be much better off! If last night‚Äôs election proved anything it proved that we need to put up GREAT Republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the House and Senate. The Democrats should be ashamed. This is a disgrace!#DrainTheSwamp Crazy Joe Scarborough and dumb as a rock Mika are not bad people but their low rated show is dominated by their NBC bosses. Too bad! Many dead including women and children in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price... Just spoke to President XI JINPING of China concerning the provocative actions of North Korea. Additional major sanctions will be imposed on North Korea today. This situation will be handled! Wow Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for ‚Äúinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.‚Äù But when will the top executives at NBC &amp; Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News. Check out Andy Lack‚Äôs past! Serious voter fraud in Virginia New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem! A Blue Wave means Crime and Open Borders. A Red Wave means Safety and Strength! WE ARE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Why was the FBI giving so much information to the Fake News Media. They are not supposed to be doing that and knowing the enemy of the people Fake News they put their own spin on it - truth doesn‚Äôt matter to them! The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem. Total disrespect for our great country! I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out. That would be very bad for the Republican Party - and please let Cryin' Chuck stay! I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade yet... Thanks to very brave Teacher &amp; Hero Jason Seaman of Noblesville Indiana for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives. His quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world! Why are Democrats fighting massive tax cuts for the middle class and business (jobs)? The reason: Obstruction and Delay! ‚ÄúProsperity is returning. Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate now as the most effective president the most successful president in modern American history.‚Äù Thank you to the great Lou Dobbs! This is an illegally brought Rigged Witch Hunt run by people who are totally corrupt and/or conflicted. It was started and paid for by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats. Phony Dossier FISA disgrace and so many lying and dishonest people already fired. 17 Angry Dems? Stay tuned! Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will soon see where it will lead hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. Only time (and talent) will tell! HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PASS THE STRONG BUT FAIR IMMIGRATION BILL KNOWN AS GOODLATTE II IN THEIR AFTERNOON VOTE TODAY EVEN THOUGH THE DEMS WON‚ÄôT LET IT PASS IN THE SENATE. PASSAGE WILL SHOW THAT WE WANT STRONG BORDERS &amp; SECURITY WHILE THE DEMS WANT OPEN BORDERS = CRIME. WIN! First responders have been doing heroic work. Their courage &amp; devotion has saved countless lives ‚Äì they represent the very best of America! No Collusion No Obstruction - but that doesn‚Äôt matter because the 13 Angry Democrats who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election. Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing! ‚ÄúMy view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier it shows that he‚Äôs been victimized. He‚Äôs been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of....... I have decided that sections of the Wall that California wants built NOW will not be built until the whole Wall is approved. Big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed. OUR COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY! HAPPY THANKSGIVING! Judge Gorsuch will be sworn in at the Rose Garden of the White House on Monday at 11:00 A.M. He will be a great Justice. Very proud of him! Good news House just passed #KatesLaw. Hopefully Senate will follow. Congratulations Eric &amp; Lara. Very proud and happy for the two of you! The big questions in Comey‚Äôs badly reviewed book aren‚Äôt answered like how come he gave up Classified Information (jail) why did he lie to Congress (jail) why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn‚Äôt they TAKE it) why the phony memos McCabe‚Äôs $700000 &amp; more? The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low. So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration perhaps more than any other President in first year. Sadly will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media! We have made more progress in the last nine months against ISIS than the Obama Administration has made in 8 years.Must be proactive &amp; nasty! Just had a long and very good talk with President Moon of South Korea. Things are going very well time and location of meeting with North Korea is being set. Also spoke to Prime Minister Abe of Japan to inform him of the ongoing negotiations. I am continuing to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations. Much work left to do but effect will be great! Business &amp; jobs will grow. Our legal system is broken! "77% of refugees allowed into U.S. since travel reprieve hail from seven suspect countries." (WT) SO DANGEROUS! What a year it‚Äôs been and we're just getting started. Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Happy New Year!! Deal with Mexico is coming along nicely. Autoworkers and farmers must be taken care of or there will be no deal. New President of Mexico has been an absolute gentleman. Canada must wait. Their Tariffs and Trade Barriers are far too high. Will tax cars if we can‚Äôt make a deal! China and the United States are working well together on trade but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China for so many years that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries. But be cool it will all work out! Our incredible U.S. Coast Guard saved more than 15000 lives last week with Harvey. Irma could be even tougher. We love our Coast Guard! The Summit with Russia was a great success except with the real enemy of the people the Fake News Media. I look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed including stopping terrorism security for Israel nuclear........ Today we remember the courage and bravery of our troops that stormed the beaches of Normandy 73 years ago. #DDay‚Ä¶ Keep hearing about "tiny" amount of money spent on Facebook ads. What about the billions of dollars of Fake News on CNN ABC NBC &amp; CBS? Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week. Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World but also for North Korea! At least 24 players kneeling this weekend at NFL stadiums that are now having a very hard time filling up. The American public is fed up with the disrespect the NFL is paying to our Country our Flag and our National Anthem. Weak and out of control! Brian Kemp is running for Governor of the great state of Georgia. The Primary is on Tuesday. Brian is tough on crime strong on the border and illegal immigration. He loves our Military and our Vets and protects our Second Amendment. I give him my full and total endorsement. Great meeting with Ford CEO Mark Fields and General Motors CEO Mary Barra at the today. I had a great meeting with NATO. They have paid $33 Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future only because of me. NATO was weak but now it is strong again (bad for Russia). The media only says I was rude to leaders never mentions the money! Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing not a bad thing. Only "stupid" people or fools would think that it is bad! We..... While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA! MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Big legal win today. U.S. judge sided with the Trump Administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great Border Wall on the Southern Border. Now this important project can go forward! After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found Chuck Schumer just stated that "Democrats should blame ourselvesnot Russia." CNN is being torn apart from within based on their being caught in a major lie and refusing to admit the mistake. Sloppy a man who lives in the past and thinks like a degenerate fool making up story after story is being laughed at all over the country! Fake News It's finally happening - Fiat Chrysler just announced plans to invest $1BILLION in Michigan and Ohio plants adding 2000 jobs. This after... When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with trade wars are good and easy to win. Example when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute don‚Äôt trade anymore-we win big. It‚Äôs easy! Our Great Larry Kudlow who has been working so hard on trade and the economy has just suffered a heart attack. He is now in Walter Reed Medical Center. Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia? The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security. The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military at a time we need it more than ever. We need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now! No more dangerous Lottery. The Democrats when they incorrectly thought they were going to win asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore! The face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who together with Nancy Pelosi have established a fine leadership team. They should always stay together and lead the Democrats who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime well into the future....and pick Crooked Hillary for Pres. It is amazing how rude much of the media is to my very hard working representatives. Be nice you will do much better! Just completed call with President Moon of South Korea. Very happy and impressed with 15-0 United Nations vote on North Korea sanctions. ‚ÄúThere has been no evidence whatsoever that Donald Trump or the campaign was involved in any kind of collusion to fix the 2016 election. In fact the evidence is the opposite that Hillary Clinton &amp; the Democrats colluded with the Russians to fix the 2016 election.‚Äù ....At what point does this soon to be $20000000 Witch Hunt composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia No Obstruction but they aren‚Äôt looking at the corruption... find the leakers within the FBI itself. Classified information is being given to media that could have a devastating effect on U.S. FIND NOW California has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime high tax problems - along with so many others. On June 5th. vote for GOP Gubernatorial Candidate JOHN COX a really good and highly competent man. He‚Äôll Make California Great Again! It is the Democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with Boarder Security and Crime. Tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by Crime coming from illegal immigration. Change the laws! New report from DOJ &amp; DHS shows that nearly 3 in 4 individuals convicted of terrorism-related charges are foreign-born. We have submitted to Congress a list of resources and reforms.... When I decided to go to Ohio for Troy Balderson he was down in early voting 64 to 36. That was not good. After my speech on Saturday night there was a big turn for the better. Now Troy wins a great victory during a very tough time of the year for voting. He will win BIG in Nov. Syrian ceasefire seems to be holding. Many lives can be saved. Came out of meeting. Good! Congressman Ron DeSantis a top student at Yale and Harvard Law School is running for Governor of the Great State of Florida. Ron is strong on Borders tough on Crime &amp; big on Cutting Taxes - Loves our Military &amp; our Vets. He will be a Great Governor &amp; has my full Endorsement! Countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to Washington to negotiate. This should have taken place many years ago butas the saying goes better late than never! If Democrats were not such obstructionists and understood the power of lower taxes we would be able to get many of their ideas into Bill! I will be going to Texas and Louisiana tomorrow with First Lady. Great progress being made! Spending weekend working at White House. So wonderful to be in Las Vegas yesterday and meet with people from police to doctors to the victims themselves who I will never forget! The Dow just broke 24000 for the first time (another all-time Record). If the Dems had won the Presidential Election the Market would be down 50% from these levels and Consumer Confidence which is also at an all-time high would be ‚Äúlow and glum!‚Äù Don't let the fake media tell you that I have changed my position on the WALL. It will get built and help stop drugs human trafficking etc. ‚ÄúStill Rising: Rasmussen Poll Shows Donald Trump Approval Ratings Now at 51 Percent‚Äù BIG CPAC STRAW POLL RESULTS: 93% APPROVE OF THE JOB PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING (Thank you!). 50% say President Trump should Tweet MORE or SAME (funny!). 79% say Republicans in Congress should do a better job of working with President Trump (starting to happen). I am not trying to get "top level security clearance" for my children. This was a typically false news story. Thank you to Rasmussen for the honest polling. Just hit 50% which is higher than Cheatin‚Äô Obama at the same time in his Administration. Stock Market just hit another record high! Jobs looking very good. Prior to departing Wisconsin I was briefed on the shooting at Capital Gazette in Annapolis Maryland. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. Thank you to all of the First Responders who are currently on the scene. President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states and lost.The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The failing NY Times Fake News story today about breast feeding must be called out. The U.S. strongly supports breast feeding but we don‚Äôt believe women should be denied access to formula. Many women need this option because of malnutrition and poverty. The European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe (U.S. has a $151 Billion trade deficit) and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO and nicely pay for it. Just doesn‚Äôt work! Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad! The Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it seem like the White House Councel had TURNED on the President when in fact it is just the opposite - &amp; the two Fake reporters knew this. This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People. So bad for America! Bikers for Trump at Bedminster earlier today. Thank you! Our Border Laws are very weak while those of Mexico &amp; Canada are very strong. Congress must change these Obama era and other laws NOW! The Democrats stand in our way - they want people to pour into our country unchecked....CRIME! We will be taking strong action today. Andrew McCabe ‚Äúin addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet) he was using allegedly his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.‚Äù Since Congress can't get its act together on HealthCare I will be using the power of the pen to give great HealthCare to many people - FAST The European Union wonderful countries who treat the U.S. very badly on trade are complaining about the tariffs on Steel &amp; Aluminum. If they drop their horrific barriers &amp; tariffs on U.S. products going in we will likewise drop ours. Big Deficit. If not we Tax Cars etc. FAIR! Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson. His trials and tribulations were great his life complex and controversial. Others have looked at this over the years most thought it would be done but yes I am considering a Full Pardon! The #FakeNews MSM doesn't report the great economic news since Election Day. #DOW up 16%. #NASDAQ up 19.5%. Drilling &amp; energy sector... Great meeting with automobile industry leaders at the this morning. Together we will #MAGA! Robert De Niro a very Low IQ individual has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies. I watched him last night and truly believe he may be ‚Äúpunch-drunk.‚Äù I guess he doesn‚Äôt... Michael Cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime. President Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled! America is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance including more than 250 years worth of beautiful clean coal. We have ended the war on coal and will continue to work to promote American energy dominance! Thank you to for your $20 billion investment that is creating more than 45000 manufacturing &amp; construction jobs in the USA! Big week coming up! The W.H. is functioning perfectly focused on HealthCare Tax Cuts/Reform &amp; many other things. I have very little time for watching T.V. Texas &amp; Louisiana: We are w/ you today we are w/ you tomorrow &amp; we will be w/ you EVERY SINGLE DAY AFTER to restore recover &amp; REBUILD! During the campaign I promised to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN by bringing businesses and jobs back to our country. I am very proud to see companies like Chrysler moving operations from Mexico to Michigan where there are so many great American workers! We will fight the #FakeNews with you! ...they do NOTHING for us with North Korea just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem! Iger where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie yet no apology. Double Standard! Will be having many meetings this weekend at The Southern White House. Big 5:00 P.M. speech in Melbourne Florida. A lot to talk about! The U.S. has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada &amp; Mexico for the 2026 World Cup. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don‚Äôt support us (including at the United Nations)? With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country! The big Caravan of People from Honduras now coming across Mexico and heading to our ‚ÄúWeak Laws‚Äù Border had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW! The Democrats do not want to help DACA. Would be so easy to make a deal! FAKE NEWS media which makes up stories and "sources" is far more effective than the discredited Democrats - but they are fading fast! Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization. Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal. She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first! Slippery James Comey a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!) will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history by far! The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy. ...realize the economy is the best it‚Äôs ever been with employment being at an all time high and many companies pouring back into our country. Wake up Punchy! Going to Charleston South Carolina in order to spend time with Boeing and talk jobs! Look forward to it. Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped as has incorrectly been reported but will be pursued and if anything substantially increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating! JOBS JOBS JOBS! Making America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely Looking forward to the Florida rally tomorrow. Big crowd expected! The Washington Post is constantly quoting ‚Äúanonymous sources‚Äù that do not exist. Rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for. They are a disgrace to journalism but then again so are many others! Too much talk not enough action. Stand for the National Anthem. U.S.A. Jobs numbers are the BEST in 44 years. If my opponent (the Democrats) had won the election they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations - the economy and jobs would have been a disaster! Earlier today I spoke with of Kentucky regarding yesterday‚Äôs shooting at Marshall County High School. My thoughts and prayers are with Bailey Holt Preston Cope their families and all of the wounded victims who are in recovery. We are with you! As to the U.N. things will be different after Jan. 20th. Almost 500000 Manufacturing Jobs created since I won the Election. Remember when my opponents were saying that we couldn‚Äôt create this type of job anymore. Wrong in fact these are among our best and most important jobs! The Obstructionist Democrats make Security for our country very difficult. They use the courts and associated delay at all times. Must stop! I told you so! The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies Google. They truly have taken advantage of the U.S. but not for long! My daughter Ivanka just arrived in South Korea. We cannot have a better or smarter person representing our country. Why isn‚Äôt the European Union and Canada informing the public that for years they have used massive Trade Tariffs and non-monetary Trade Barriers against the U.S. Totally unfair to our farmers workers &amp; companies. Take down your tariffs &amp; barriers or we will more than match you! Our relationship with Mexico is getting closer by the hour. Some really good people within both the new and old government and all working closely together....A big Trade Agreement with Mexico could be happening soon! Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place including the fully loaded ships at sea Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted! 62 years ago this week a brave seamstress in Montgomery Alabama uttered one word that changed history... MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! New Poll - A majority of Americans think that John Brennan and James Comey should have their Security Clearances Revoked. Not surprised! The economy is looking really good. It has been many years that we have seen these kind of numbers. The underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better. Not only does the media give a platform to hate groups but the media turns a blind eye to the gang violence on our streets! Leaving Hamburg for Washington D.C. and the WH. Just left China‚Äôs President Xi where we had an excellent meeting on trade &amp; North Korea. Governor Jerry ‚ÄúMoonbeam‚Äù Brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include (1) Kidnapping and Robbery (2) Badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize (3) Dealing drugs. Is this really what the great people of California want? Texas is healing fast thanks to all of the great men &amp; women who have been working so hard. But still so much to do. Will be back tomorrow! Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have! While I had a great meeting with NATO raising vast amounts of money I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Sadly it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy! 70 Record Closes for the Dow so far this year! We have NEVER had 70 Dow Records in a one year period. Wow! ....the only Collusion with Russia was with the Democrats so now they are looking at my Tweets (along with 53 million other people) - the rigged Witch Hunt continues! How stupid and unfair to our Country....And so the Fake News doesn‚Äôt waste my time with dumb questions NO.... The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated &amp; demoralized Dems Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is "sick." All G 20 leaders and spouses were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew! The migrant ‚Äòcaravan‚Äô that is openly defying our border shows how weak &amp; ineffective U.S. immigration laws are. Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda ‚Äì Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities. We need lawmakers who will put America First. While the Fake News loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating just showed that my rating on Dec. 28 2017 was approximately the same as President Obama on Dec. 28 2009 which was 47%...and this despite massive negative Trump coverage &amp; Russia hoax! FAIR TRADE! ...We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia! If the people of our great country could only see how viciously and inaccurately my administration is covered by certain media! For those of you who are still interested the Democrats have totally forgotten about DACA. Not a lot of interest on this subject from them! The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come &amp; go and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos only great Energy! The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory - 306! The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls. There was no Collusion except by the Democrats! I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray a man of impeccable credentials to be the new Director of the FBI. Details to follow. Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake &amp; Corrupt Russia Investigation headed up by the all Democrat loyalists or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA &amp; Comey letter). No Collusion so they go crazy! Time to end the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans. Thank you to General John Kelly who is doing a fantastic job and all of the Staff and others in the White House for a job well done. Long hours and Fake reporting makes your job more difficult but it is always great to WIN and few have won more than us! Today we broke ground on a plant that will provide jobs for up to 15000 Wisconsin Workers! As Foxconn has discovered there is no better place to build hire and grow than right here in the United States! So true thank you! Wow is blowing away the competition in the morning ratings. Morning Joe is a dead show with very few people watching and sadly Fake News CNN is also doing poorly. Too much hate and inaccurately reported stories - too predictable! Wow what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort who has represented Ronald Reagan Bob Dole and many other top political people and campaigns. Didn‚Äôt know Manafort was the head of the Mob. What about Comey and Crooked Hillary and all of the others? Very unfair! Thank you Brian Krzanich CEO of A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS!‚Ä¶ Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U.S. keeps raising interest rates. Not acceptable! A.P. has just reported that the Russian Hoax Investigation has now cost our government over $17 million and going up fast. No Collusion except by the Democrats! Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart! The Obstructionist Democrats have given us (or not fixed) some of the worst trade deals in World History. I am changing that fast! ‚ÄúAnonymous Sources are really starting to BURN the media.‚Äù The fact is that many anonymous sources don‚Äôt even exist. They are fiction made up by the Fake News reporters. Look at the lie that Fake CNN is now in. They got caught red handed! Enemy of the People! A working dinner tonight with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and his representatives at the Winter White House (Mar-a-Lago). Very good talks! Just returned home to the beautiful White House from Dallas where the Arena was packed to the rafters with the great fans and supporters of the It was so wonderful to be there! Rep. Lou Barletta a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters will make a FANTASTIC Senator. He is strong &amp; smart loves Pennsylvania &amp; loves our Country! Voted for Tax Cuts unlike Bob Casey who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer! The Senate Democrats have only confirmed 48 of 197 Presidential Nominees. They can't win so all they do is slow things down &amp; obstruct! Why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision? Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea. Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs saying that they are individuals &amp; must be nurtured or asking to end your big Tax Cuts &amp; raise your taxes instead. Dems have lost touch! Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner.The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off &amp; use better! Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama. We need his vote on stopping crime illegal immigration Border Wall Military Pro Life V.A. Judges 2nd Amendment and more. No to Jones a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet! Look forward to being in the Great State of Michigan tonight. Major business expansion and jobs pouring into your State. Auto companies expanding at record pace. Big crowd tonight will be live on T.V. A story in the that I was close to ‚Äúrescinding‚Äù the nomination of Justice Gorsuch prior to confirmation is FAKE NEWS. I never even wavered and am very proud of him and the job he is doing as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The unnamed sources don‚Äôt exist! The Fake News Media has never been so wrong or so dirty. Purposely incorrect stories and phony sources to meet their agenda of hate. Sad! Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democrats...totally abandoned! Republicans are still working hard. Great Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot. Big gain over last 4 weeks. I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans the Cuts the Dems want to take away. We need more Republicans! ...Four reporters spotted Melania in the White House last week walking merrily along to a meeting. They never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world was really ill or whatever. Fake News is really bad! ‚ÄúBET founder: Trump's economy is bringing black workers back into the labor force‚Äù Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his "no reason to be alarmed" statement. MSM is working hard to sell it! Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County Florida. Will never forget them or the evening! Troy Balderson of Ohio is running for Congress against a Nancy Pelosi Liberal who is WEAK on Crime &amp; Borders. Troy is the total opposite and loves our Military Vets &amp; 2nd Amendment. EARLY VOTING just started with Election Day on August 7th. Troy has my Full &amp; Total Endorsement! JFK Files are being carefully released. In the end there will be great transparency. It is my hope to get just about everything to public! Fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud as is the rigged investigation he started. There was no Collusion or Obstruction with Russia and everybody including the Democrats know it. The only Collusion and Obstruction was by Crooked Hillary the Democrats and the DNC! My thoughts and prayers are with the families of our serviceman who was killed and his fellow servicemen who were wounded in Somalia. They are truly all HEROES. Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change Democrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our Government hence the American People. They are ‚Äúslow walking‚Äù all of my nominations - hundreds of people. At this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals! Gina Haspel did a spectacular job today. There is nobody even close to run the CIA! Today I was honored and proud to address the 45th Annual You are living witnesses of this year‚Äôs March for Life theme: #LoveSavesLives. Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently "I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer." Then acts so indignant. #draintheswamp The U.S. has gained more than 5.2 trillion dollars in Stock Market Value since Election Day! Also record business enthusiasm. I look forward to all meetings today with world leaders including my meeting with Vladimir Putin. Much to discuss.#G20Summit #USAüá∫üá∏ In new Quinnipiac Poll 66% of people feel the economy is ‚ÄúExcellent or Good.‚Äù That is the highest number ever recorded by this poll. Memorial service today for beautiful and incredible Heather Heyer a truly special young woman. She will be long remembered by all! General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier Uranium Speeches Emails and the Podesta Company! Study the late Joseph McCarthy because we are now in period with Mueller and his gang that make Joseph McCarthy look like a baby! Rigged Witch Hunt! Homeland Security did a fabulous job yesterday at the press conference explaining security at the border and for our country while at the same time recommending changes to obsolete &amp; nasty laws which force family separation. We want ‚Äúheart‚Äù and security in America! ..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA! The failing writes total fiction concerning me. They have gotten it wrong for two years and now are making up stories &amp; sources! China which is a great economic power is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization. They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S. ....If this is done illegal immigration will be stopped in it‚Äôs tracks - and at very little by comparison cost. This is the only real answer - and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL! It‚Äôs the Democrats fault they won‚Äôt give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation. They want open borders which breeds horrible crime. Republicans want security. But I am working on something - it never ends! I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal? Very 'cowardly!' I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù took a 12 year old tax case among other things applied tremendous pressure on him and unlike Michael Cohen he refused to ‚Äúbreak‚Äù - make up stories in order to get a ‚Äúdeal.‚Äù Such respect for a brave man! is now whimpering to all that he did the famous ‚Äúhair show‚Äù with me (where he seriously messed up my hair) &amp; that he would have now done it differently because it is said to have ‚Äúhumanized‚Äù me-he is taking heat. He called &amp; said ‚Äúmonster ratings.‚Äù Be a man Jimmy! My transition team which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA A complete Witch Hunt! Slippery James Comey the worst FBI Director in history was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where by the way there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems)! WE LOVE YOU LAS VEGAS! With all of its phony unnamed sources &amp; highly slanted &amp; even fraudulent reporting #Fake News is DISTORTING DEMOCRACY in our country! Phoenix crowd last night was amazing - a packed house. I love the Great State of Arizona. Not a fan of Jeff Flake weak on crime &amp; border! So funny the Democrats have sued the Republicans for Winning. Now he R‚Äôs counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material including Servers and Emails! When we have an ‚Äúinfestation‚Äù of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country who do we send to get them out? ICE! They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov. A woman I don‚Äôt know and to the best of my knowledge never met is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago. Never happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security...... The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them ‚ÄúI have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un‚Äù (of N. Korea). Obviously I didn‚Äôt say that. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un‚Äù a big difference. Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters... Is it true the DNC would not allow the FBI access to check server or other equipment after learning it was hacked? Can that be possible? My son Donald will be interviewed by tonight at 10:00 P.M. He is a great person who loves our country! After North Korea missile launch it's more important than ever to fund our gov't &amp; military! Dems shouldn't hold troop funding hostage for amnesty &amp; illegal immigration. I ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big. They can't now threaten a shutdown to get their demands. ....Also why is Mueller only appointing Angry Dems some of whom have worked for Crooked Hillary others including himself have worked for Obama....And why isn‚Äôt Mueller looking at all of the criminal activity &amp; real Russian Collusion on the Democrats side-Podesta Dossier? Really great numbers on jobs &amp; the economy! Things are starting to kick in now and we have just begun! Don't like steel &amp; aluminum dumping! Stock Market hits another all time high on Friday. 5.3 trillion dollars up since Election. Fake News doesn't spent much time on this! Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela. Should be landing in D.C. this evening and be in the White House with his family at about 7:00 P.M. The great people of Utah will be very happy! I am pleased to announce that effective 4/9/18 will be my new National Security Advisor. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job &amp; will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9. Monitoring the terrible situation in Florida. Just spoke to Governor Scott. Thoughts and prayers for all. Stay safe! Putting Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Puppet Jones into office in Alabama would hurt our great Republican Agenda of low on taxes tough on crime strong on military and borders...&amp; so much more. Look at your 401-k‚Äôs since Election. Highest Stock Market EVER! Jobs are roaring back! The White House is running very smoothly despite phony Witch Hunts etc. There is great Energy and unending Stamina both necessary to get things done. We are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so! Fake News is going ‚Äúbonkers!‚Äù ..But the people were Pro-Trump! Virtually no President has accomplished what we have accomplished in the first 9 months-and economy roaring Fake News is at an all time high. Where is their apology to me for all of the incorrect stories??? Dems have been complaining for months &amp; months about Dir. Comey. Now that he has been fired they PRETEND to be aggrieved. Phony hypocrites! By the way if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn't they stop them? Getting ready to leave for Poland after which I will travel to Germany for the G-20. Will be back on Saturday. The Iran Deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing we know what will happen. In just a short time the world‚Äôs leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world‚Äôs most dangerous weapons.... So funny! I just checked out Fake News CNN for the first time in a long time (they are dying in the ratings) to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of Jim Acosta (actually a nice guy). They didn‚Äôt! But they did say I already lost in my meeting with Putin. Fake News...... Either we need to elect more Republicans in November or Republicans must end the ridiculous 60 vote or Filibuster rule - or better yet do both. Cryin‚Äô Chuck would do it on day one but we‚Äôll never give him the chance. Some great legislation awaits - be smart! Getting closer and closer on the Tax Cut Bill. Shaping up even better than projected. House and Senate working very hard and smart. End result will be not only important but SPECIAL! Working hard on the biggest tax cut in U.S. history. Great support from so many sides. Big winners will be the middle class business &amp; JOBS Someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday. The election is over! #StopTheBias A Democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to Repeal the GOP Tax Cuts (no chance). This is too good to be true for Republicans...Remember the Nancy Pelosi Dems are also weak on Crime the Border and want to be gentle and kind to MS-13 gang members...not good! Stock Market up 5 months in a row! With Jemele Hill at the mike it is no wonder ESPN ratings have "tanked" in fact tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry! NBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN. They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down! I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn and all other requested members of the White House Staff to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel. In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. Most transparent in history. No Collusion No Obstruction. Witch Hunt! Despite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Nevertheless Germany owes..... One by one we are keeping our promises - on the border on energy on jobs on regulations. Big changes are happening! Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get! Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election! Where is the DNC Server and why didn‚Äôt Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it? Why isn‚Äôt Hillary/Russia being looked at? So many questions so much corruption! As only one of two people left who could become President why wouldn‚Äôt the FBI or Department of ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù have told me that they were secretly investigating Paul Manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign? Should have told me! JFK Files are released long ahead of schedule! The Green Party just dropped its recount suit in Pennsylvania and is losing votes in Wisconsin recount. Just a Stein scam to raise money! A.G. Lynch made law enforcement decisions for political purposes...gave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection. Totally illegal! Today we lost a great pioneer of air and space in John Glenn. He was a hero and inspired generations of future explorers. He will be missed. The Fake News refuses to report the success of the first 6 months: S.C. surging economy &amp; jobsborder &amp; military securityISIS &amp; MS-13 etc. ‚ÄúYour paycheck is bigger your pension is stronger.‚Äù Unemployment numbers are better than they have been in 50 years &amp; perhaps ever. Our country is booming like never before - and it will get even better! Many companies moving back to the U.S.A. Our big and very popular Tax Cut and Reform Bill has taken on an unexpected new source of ‚Äúlove‚Äù - that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses. This is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of and now it is the rage. Merry Christmas! As long as I campaign and/or support Senate and House candidates (within reason) they will win! I LOVE the people &amp; they certainly seem to like the job I‚Äôm doing. If I find the time in between China Iran the Economy and much more which I must we will have a giant Red Wave! If we don‚Äôt have a wall system we‚Äôre not going to have a country. Congress must fund the BORDER WALL &amp; prohibit grants to sanctuary jurisdictions that threaten the security of our country &amp; the people of our country. We must enforce our laws &amp; protect our people! #BuildTheWall The rigged Dem Primary one of the biggest political stories in years got ZERO coverage on Fake News Network TV last night. Disgraceful! Democrats want Open Borders and they want to abolish ICE the brave men and women that are protecting our Country from some of the most vicious and dangerous people on earth! Sorry we can‚Äôt let that happen! Also change the rules in the Senate and approve STRONG Border Security! 5 for 5! Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections which is what the Democrats always intended? Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late! Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election. The U.S. is acting swiftly on Intellectual Property theft. We cannot allow this to happen as it has for many years! Bad ratings &amp; got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall. They probably knew it was Fake News but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway. Two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise! My thoughts and prayers are with the and their loved ones. We are with you!#LESM The Democrats without a leader have become the party of obstruction.They are only interested in themselves and not in what's best for U.S. Canada charges the U.S. a 270% tariff on Dairy Products! They didn‚Äôt tell you that did they? Not fair to our farmers! Kim Strassel of the WSJ just said after reviewing the dumb Comey Memos ‚Äúyou got to ask what was the purpose of the Special Counsel? There‚Äôs no there there.‚Äù Dan Henninger of the WSJ said Memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought! Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally. The list of bad players in the FBI &amp; DOJ gets longer &amp; longer. Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion No Obstruction - I just fight back! All of this "Russia" talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts &amp; Reform. Is this coincidental? NOT! Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation to 2500 Iranians - including to government officials. How big (and bad) is that? I have been briefed on the U.S. C-130 ‚ÄúHercules‚Äù cargo plane from the Puerto Rico National Guard that crashed near Savannah Hilton Head International Airport. Please join me in thoughts and prayers for the victims their families and the great men and women of the National Guard. Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Councilhe will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! The Heritage Foundation has just stated that 64% of the Trump Agenda is already done faster than even Ronald Reagan. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre blown away‚Äù said Thomas Binion of Heritage President Trump ‚Äúis very active very conservative and very effective. Huge volume &amp; spectrum of issues.‚Äù Remember when they were saying during the campaign that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary‚Äôs large and highly sophisticated staff. Well not saying that anymore! School shooting in Texas. Early reports not looking good. God bless all! In the coming months and years ahead I look forward to building an even STRONGER relationship between the United States and China. üá∫üá∏üá®üá≥ Big progress being made in ridding our country of MS-13 gang members and gang members in general. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! Ex-FBI LAYER Lisa Page today defied a House of Representatives issued Subpoena to testify before Congress! Wow but is anybody really surprised! Together with her lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER! Our first duty and our highest loyalty is to the citizens of the United States. We will not rest until our border is secure our citizens are safe and we finally end the immigration crisis once and for all. Senator Claire McCaskill of the GREAT State of Missouri flew around in a luxurious private jet during her RV tour of the state. RV‚Äôs are not for her. People are really upset so phony! Josh Hawley should win big and has my full endorsement. Statement by me last night in Florida: ‚ÄúHonestly I don‚Äôt think the Democrats want to make a deal. They talk about DACA but they don‚Äôt want to help..We are ready willing and able to make a deal but they don‚Äôt want to. They don‚Äôt want security at the border they don‚Äôt want..... How the hell is Bruce Ohr still employed at the Justice Department? Disgraceful! Witch Hunt! The Wall is the Wall it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it. Parts will be of necessity see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains wastelands or tough rivers or water..... Just watched the totally biased and fake news reports of the so-called Russia story on NBC and ABC. Such dishonesty! Time to start building in our country with American workers &amp; with American iron aluminum &amp; steel. It is time to‚Ä¶ Where‚Äôs the Collusion? They made up a phony crime called Collusion and when there was no Collusion they say there was Obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed). If you FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt they scream Obstruction! Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Emails many of which are Classified Information got hacked by China. Next move better be by the FBI &amp; DOJ or after all of their other missteps (Comey McCabe Strzok Page Ohr FISA Dirty Dossier etc.) their credibility will be forever gone! ‚ÄúTrump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign‚Äù No James Clapper I am not happy. Spying on a campaign would be illegal and a scandal to boot! Happy National Anthem Day! Why doesn‚Äôt the Fake News Media state that the Trump Administration‚Äôs Anti-Trust Division has been and is opposed to the AT&amp;T purchase of Time Warner in a currently ongoing Trial. Such a disgrace in reporting! As it has turned out James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her! Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign by the people and party in absolute power for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? And to think that the party in question even with the expenditure of far more money LOST! Thank you ‚ÄúThe President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what‚Äôs he supposed to think?‚Äù WITCH HUNT! Good news out of the House with the passing of 'No Sanctuary for Criminals Act.' Hopefully Senate will follow. Dems are no longer talking DACA! ‚ÄúOut of sight out of mind‚Äù they say. DACA beneficiaries should not be happy. Nancy Pelosi truly doesn‚Äôt care about them. Republicans stand ready to make a deal! Happy #StPatricksDay Happy Birthday to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas a friend and great man! North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States..... Thank you to the incredible Law Enforcement Officers from the Palm Beach County Sheriff‚Äôs Office. They keep us safe and are very cool about it! ....great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being. Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire and now for no reason whatsoever his reputation has been shattered. Not fair Tester! WITCH HUNT! So sorry people wanting to get into the already packed arena - I LOVE YOU ALL! What does the Department of Justice and FBI have to hide? Why aren‚Äôt they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE? Stalling but for what reason? Not looking good! Tariffs are the greatest! Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with Tariffs. It‚Äôs as simple as that - and everybody‚Äôs talking! Remember we are the ‚Äúpiggy bank‚Äù that‚Äôs being robbed. All will be Great! Jeff Sessions said he wouldn‚Äôt allow politics to influence him only because he doesn‚Äôt understand what is happening underneath his command position. Highly conflicted Bob Mueller and his gang of 17 Angry Dems are having a field day as real corruption goes untouched. No Collusion! Our two great republics are linked together by the timeless bonds of history culture and destiny. We are people who cherish our values protect our civilization and recognize the image of God in every human soul. Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA! My job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field. #AmericaFirstüá∫üá∏‚û°Ô∏è‚Ä¶ Hiring manythousands of judges and going through a long and complicated legal process is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional. People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U.S. illegally. Children brought back to their country...... The "deplorables" came back to haunt Hillary.They expressed their feelings loud and clear. She spent big money but in the end had no game! Congratulations to our new National Security Advisor General H.R. McMaster. Video: I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie! ‚ÄúIt was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice Department in misleading the Court by using this Dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the Trump Team. This is a Clinton Campaign document. It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump.... FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT! Senator Schumer and Obama Administration let phone company ZTE flourish with no security checks. I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees change of management and board must purchase U.S. parts and pay a $1.3 Billion fine. Dems do nothing.... More and more people are suggesting that Republicans (and me) should be given Equal Time on T.V. when you look at the one-sided coverage? Great Army - Navy Game. Army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF‚ÄôS TROPHY! Congratulations! ‚ÄúJohn Brennan is a stain on the Country we deserve better than this.‚Äù Former Secret Service Agent and author of new book ‚ÄúSpygate the Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump‚Äù Dan Bongino. Thank you Dan and good luck with the book! South Korea is finding as I have told them that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work they only understand one thing! ....Also there is NO COLLUSION! Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING but would Peace House/Freedom House on the Border of North &amp; South Korea be a more Representative Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking! ‚ÄúFox News has learned that Bruce Ohr wrote Christopher Steele following the firing of James Comey saying that he was afraid the anti-Trump Russia probe will be exposed.‚Äù Charles Payne How much more does Mueller have to see? They have blinders on - RIGGED! 3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning let ObamaCare implode then deal. Watch! With Irma and Harvey devastation Tax Cuts and Tax Reform is needed more than ever before. Go Congress go! The Caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of Mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our Border. Because of the Trump Administrations actions Border crossings are at a still UNACCEPTABLE 46 year low. Stop drugs! 'Trump signs bill undoing Obama coal mining rule' Iran is rapidly taking over more and more of Iraq even after the U.S. has squandered three trillion dollars there. Obvious long ago! If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now they should immediately REPEAL and then REPLACE at a later date! Happy Birthday to the leader of the Democrat Party Maxine Waters! ....your release possible and HAVE A GREAT LIFE! Be careful there are many pitfalls on the long and winding road of life! The Fake News Washington Post Amazon‚Äôs ‚Äúchief lobbyist‚Äù has another (of many) phony headlines ‚ÄúTrump Defiant As China Adds Trade Penalties.‚Äù WRONG! Should read ‚ÄúTrump Defiant as U.S. Adds Trade Penalties Will End Barriers And Massive I.P. Theft.‚Äù Typically bad reporting! The states today that DJT believes "more countries should acquire nuclear weapons." How dishonest are they. I never said this! ...Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI and still hasn't? It's all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election! Come on Republican Senators you can do it on Healthcare. After 7 years this is your chance to shine! Don't let the American people down! The big story is the "unmasking and surveillance" of people that took place during the Obama Administration. Under our potential deal with China they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce. Allegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false. The Secret Service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family. Tester should resign. The..... Wonderful coordination between Federal State and Local Governments in the Great State of Texas - TEAMWORK! Record setting rainfall. Because of #FakeNews my people are not getting the credit they deserve for doing a great job. As seen here they are ALL doing a GREAT JOB! Just spoke to to pay my highest respect and condolences to the families of the terrible Humboldt Team tragedy. May God be with them all! Why Isn't the Senate Intel Committee looking into the Fake News Networks in OUR country to see why so much of our news is just made up-FAKE! End the Democrats Obstruction! Hard to believe that the Democrats who have gone so far LEFT that they are no longer recognizable are fighting so hard for Sanctuary crime A very nice note from Chairman Kim of North Korea. Great progress being made! Today the House took major steps toward securing our schools by passing the STOP School Violence Act. We must put the safety of America's children FIRST by improving training and by giving schools and law enforcement better tools. A tragedy like Parkland can't happen ever again! ..North Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China which is trying to help but with little success. Too bad a large portion of the Media refuses to report the lies and corruption having to do with the Rigged Witch Hunt - but that is why we call them FAKE NEWS! Law enforcement &amp; military did a spectacular job in Hamburg. Everybody felt totally safe despite the anarchists. #G20Summit ‚ÄúHillary Clinton clearly got a pass by the FBI. We have the unfortunate situation where they then decided they were going to frame Donald Trump‚Äù concerning the Rigged Witch Hunt. JOE DIGENOVA former U.S. Attorney. ...is all of the illegal leaks of classified and other information. It is a total "witch hunt!" Thank you to all of the men and women who protect &amp; serve our communities 24/7/365! #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay‚Ä¶ I will be having lunch at the White House today with Republican Senators concerning healthcare. They MUST keep their promise to America! Why is Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) perhaps in a near drunken state claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt knows? Isn‚Äôt this highly illegal. Is it being investigated? I have confidence that Kim Jong Un will honor the contract we signed &amp; even more importantly our handshake. We agreed to the denuclearization of North Korea. China on the other hand may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on Chinese Trade-Hope Not! If the person placed very early into my campaign wasn‚Äôt a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal... I look forward to paying my respects to our brave men and women on this Memorial Day at Arlington National Cemetery later this morning. I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. He is a Great American.... ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION....I have seen nothing the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because he‚Äôs exercising his power as the President of the U.S. I just don‚Äôt see it.‚Äù Judge Ken Starr Add the 2026 World Cup to our long list of accomplishments! President Xi thank you for such an incredible welcome ceremony. It was a truly memorable and impressive display! 122 vicious prisoners released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo have returned to the battlefield. Just another terrible decision! Republican Tax Cuts are looking very good. All are working hard. In the meantime the Stock Market hit another record high! I hope the Fake News Media keeps talking about Wacky Congresswoman Wilson in that she as a representative is killing the Democrat Party! Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. They were caught red handed just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News (who should be immediately fired for his ‚Äúmistake‚Äù). Watch to see if fires those responsible or was it just gross incompetence? Since Election Day on November 8 the Stock Market is up more than 25% unemployment is at a 17 year low &amp; companies are coming back to U.S. We need a 21st century MERIT-BASED immigration system. Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security. Today my Administration is launching the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American People. We will have tougher negotiation more competition and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter! My highly respected nominee for CIA Director Gina Haspel has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists. Think of that in these very dangerous times we have the most qualified person a woman who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror. Win Gina! Just finished a very good meeting with the President of South Korea. Many subjects discussed including North Korea and new trade deal!

You can thank Congress the same people that can't even give us HCare! Please tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the U.S. massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers. The EU trade surplus with the U.S. is $151 Billion and Canada keeps our farmers and others out. Look forward to seeing them tomorrow. Had a very good call last night with the President of China concerning the menace of North Korea. Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can't I will revisit this issue! Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L.Bean. Looking forward to 3:30 P.M. meeting today at the White House. We have to protect &amp; build our Steel and Aluminum Industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends and treat us fairly on both trade and the military. Bringing hundreds of billions of dollars back to the U.S.A. from the Middle East - which will mean JOBS JOBS JOBS! I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it. I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States. Great to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS. Huge win for American workers and the USA! Ralph Northamwho is running for Governor of Virginiais fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs &amp; sanctuary cities. Vote Ed Gillespie! Congratulations to Patrick Reed on his great and courageous MASTERS win! When Patrick had his amazing win at Doral 5 years ago people saw his great talent and a bright future ahead. Now he is the Masters Champion! Working hard thank you! 80% of Mexico‚Äôs Exports come to the United States. They totally rely on us which is fine with me. They do have though very strong Immigration Laws. The U.S. has pathetically weak and ineffective Immigration Laws that the Democrats refuse to help us fix. Will speak to Mexico! The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win.. Headline: ‚ÄúKim Prepared to Cede Nuclear Weapons if U.S. Pledges Not to Invade‚Äù - from the Failing New York Times. Also will shut down Nuclear Test Site in May. Unless the Republican Senators are total quitters Repeal &amp; Replace is not dead! Demand another vote before voting on any other bill! It is time to rebuild OUR country to bring back OUR jobs to restore OUR dreams &amp; yes to put #AmericaFirst! TY O‚Ä¶ When you give a crazed crying lowlife a break and give her a job at the White House I guess it just didn‚Äôt work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog! Was just named the most influential show in news? You deserve it - three great people! The many Fake News Hate Shows should study your formula for success! Tonight we gathered to celebrate the courageous men and women who make freedom possible: our brave service members and our wonderful Veterans. For 242 years American Independence... Our great country is respected again in Asia. You will see the fruits of our long but successful trip for many years to come! North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen! I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate. News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A.M. What many people don‚Äôt understand or don‚Äôt want to understand is that Wayne Chris and the folks who work so hard at the are Great People and Great American Patriots. They love our Country and will do the right thing. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Consumer Confidence is at an All-Time High along with a Record High Stock Market. Unemployment is at a 17 year low. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Working to pass MASSIVE TAX CUTS (looking good). The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary! Spoke to Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys yesterday. Jerry is a winner who knows how to get things done. Players will stand for Country! Having a great time hosting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the United States! I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare. They really want to get it right unlike OCare! ....Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety DACA has now taken a big step backwards. The Dems will threaten ‚Äúshutdown‚Äù but what they are really doing is shutting down our military at a time we need it most. Get smart MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt some game. You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States.‚Äù John Dowd March 2018. With North Korea China the Middle East and so much more there is not much time to be thinking about this especially since there was no Russian ‚ÄúCollusion.‚Äù With all my Administration has done on Legislative Approvals (broke Harry Truman‚Äôs Record) Regulation Cutting Judicial Appointments Building Military VA TAX CUTS &amp; REFORM Record Economy/Stock Market and so much more I am sure great credit will be given by mainstream news? The Democrats continue to Obstruct the confirmation of hundreds of good and talented people who are needed to run our government...A record in U.S. history. State Department Ambassadors and many others are being slow walked. Senate must approve NOW! Prosperity is coming back to our shores because we are putting America WORKERS and FAMILIES first. #AmericaFirstüá∫üá∏ Thank you to former campaign adviser Michael Caputo for saying so powerfully that there was no Russian collusion in our winning campaign. Good luck to Alice Johnson. Have a wonderful life! TO ALL One of the reasons we need Great Border Security is that Mexico‚Äôs murder rate in 2017 increased by 27% to 31174 people killed a record! The Democrats want Open Borders. I want Maximum Border Security and respect for ICE and our great Law Enforcement Professionals! A great First Lady! The failing was forced to apologize to its subscribers for the poor reporting it did on my election win. Now they are worse! FBI Agent Peter Strzok who headed the Clinton &amp; Russia investigations texted to his lover Lisa Page in the IG Report that ‚Äúwe‚Äôll stop‚Äù candidate Trump from becoming President. Doesn‚Äôt get any lower than that! ....This is real collusion and dishonesty. Major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering - where is our Justice Department? ‚ÄúBob Mueller isn‚Äôt your whole investigation premised on a Fake Dossier paid for by Hillary created by a man who hates Donald Trump &amp; used to con a FISA Court Judge. Bob I really think it‚Äôs time for you to give up your phony investigation.‚Äù No Collusion! When the media - driven insane by their Trump Derangement Syndrome - reveals internal deliberations of our government it truly puts the lives of many not just journalists at risk! Very unpatriotic! Freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news... Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida is one of the finest and most talented people in Congress. Strong on Crime the Border Illegal Immigration the 2nd Amendment our great Military &amp; Vets Matt worked tirelessly on helping to get our Massive Tax Cuts. He has my Full Endorsement!

For the first time in many decades we are protecting our workers! Gina Haspel my highly respected nominee to lead the CIA is being praised for the fact that she has been and alway will be TOUGH ON TERROR! This is a woman who has been a leader wherever she has gone. The CIA wants her to lead them into America‚Äôs bright and glorious future! Thank you "Huge win for President Trump and GOP in Georgia Congressional Special Election." Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace! The Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. Wrong. I am VERY happy with my lawyers John Dowd Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job and..... European Union representatives told me that they would start buying soybeans from our great farmers immediately. Also they will be buying vast amounts of LNG! America is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Poland in the fight to eradicate the evils of terrorism and extremism. #POTUSinPoland The Fake News is going crazy with wacky Congresswoman Wilson(D) who was SECRETLY on a very personal call and gave a total lie on content!

JOBS JOBS JOBS! The Rigged Witch Hunt headed by the 13 Angry Democrats (and now 4 more have been added one who worked directly for Obama W.H.) seems intent on damaging the Republican Party‚Äôs chances in the November Election.

He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving ISIS OCare etc. Chinese President XI JINPING and I spoke at length about the meeting with KIM JONG UN of North Korea. President XI told me he appreciates that the U.S. is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative. China continues to be helpful! Mike Pompeo is outstanding. First in his class at West Point. A top student at Harvard Law School. A success at whatever he has done. We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP. He will be a great Secretary of State! Democrats in Congress must no longer Obstruct - vote to fix our terrible Immigration Laws now. I am watching what is going on from Europe - it would be soooo simple to fix. Judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works. They are just using children!

So much of the media is dishonest and corrupt! did a spectacular job hosting the President of France and his wife Brigitte. Every detail was done to perfection. The State Dining Room never looked more beautiful and Washington is abuzz over what an incredible job Melania did.

Just got back to the White House from the Great States of Texas and Louisiana where things are going well. Such cooperation &amp; coordination!

Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems Justice FBI &amp; Russia? As has been stated by numerous legal scholars I have the absolute right to PARDON myself but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime the never ending Witch Hunt led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (&amp; others) continues into the mid-terms!

Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!

Even though the Dems want to Obstruct we will Repeal &amp; Replace right after Tax Cuts! North Korea has not conducted a Missile Test since November 28 2017 and has promised not to do so through our meetings. I believe they will honor that commitment! Deputy A.G.

Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia.... Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats lead by their fearless leader Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election.

Next she was a bad candidate! ...Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation use Nuclear Option if necessary to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People.

Will be going to North Dakota today to discuss tax reform and tax cuts. We are the highest taxed nation in the world - that will change. Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted for political purposes into my campaign for president.

Much will be accomplished this week on trade the military and security! As ridiculous as it sounds the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from. A whole big wasted procedure must take place.

Russia U.K. China Saudi Arabia Japan ...big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible‚Äù (among many other things). ‚ÄúPresident Trump reversed the policies of President Obama and reversed our economic decline.‚Äù Thank you Stuart Varney. When a politician admits that ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to make America great again‚Äù there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much reason to ever vote for him.

A highly respected Federal judge today stated that the ‚ÄúTrump Administration gets great credit‚Äù for reuniting illegal families. Thank you and please look at the previous administrations record - not good!

Not acceptable! All NATO Nations must meet their 2% commitment and that must ultimately go to 4%! The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College &amp; lost! How can the Democrats who are weak on the Border and weak on Crime do well in November.

Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought? Great talk with my friend President Mauricio Macri of Argentina this week. He is doing such a good job for Argentina. I support his vision for transforming his country‚Äôs economy and unleashing its potential! I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss! In times of tragedy the bonds that sustain us are those of family faith community and country. These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need. The soon to be released book ‚ÄúThe Russia Hoax The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton And Frame Donald Trump‚Äù written by Gregg Jarrett looks like a real deal big hit. The Phony Witch Hunt will be opened up for the world to see! Out in 5 weeks. Does anybody really want to throw out good educated and accomplished young people who have jobs some serving in the military? Really!..... Our economy is perhaps BETTER than it has ever been. Companies doing really well and moving back to America and jobs numbers are the best in 44 years. So great that John McCain is coming back to vote. Brave - American hero! Thank you John. Arrived back in Washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major U.S. Steel plant in Granite City Illinois only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the highly conflicted Robert Mueller and his gang of 13 Angry Democrats obviously cannot find Collusion... ....lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more) which is unfair to our great country - and I am very happy with my existing team. Besides there was NO COLLUSION with Russia except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems! ‚ÄúFBI Agent Peter Strzok (on the Mueller team) should have recused himself on day one. He was out to STOP THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP. He needed an insurance policy. Those are illegal improper goals trying to influence the Election. He should never ever been allowed to........ Our Country was built on Tariffs and Tariffs are now leading us to great new Trade Deals - as opposed to the horrible and unfair Trade Deals that I inherited as your President. Other Countries should not be allowed to come in and steal the wealth of our great U.S.A. No longer! Billions of additional dollars are being spent by NATO countries since my visit last year at my request but it isn‚Äôt nearly enough. U.S. spends too much. Europe‚Äôs borders are BAD! Pipeline dollars to Russia are not acceptable! Ralph Norman ran a fantastic race to win in the Great State of South Carolina's 5th District. We are all honored by your success tonight! With Spies or ‚ÄúInformants‚Äù as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it‚Äôs not) all over my campaign even from a very early date why didn‚Äôt the crooked highest levels of the FBI or ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù contact me to tell me of the phony Russia problem? Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for. Don‚Äôt forget Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats and with the economy doing record numbers we will continue to win even bigger than before! Loved being on this morning. Great show! While we are on the subject it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y. Times reports that ‚Äúthe size of the company‚Äôs lobbying staff has ballooned‚Äù and that... Lou Dobbs: ‚ÄúThis cannot go forward...this Special Counsel with all of his conflicts with his 17 Angry Democrats without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia. The Dems are the ones who should be investigated.‚Äù Thank you Lou so true! Gina Haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the CIA. She is exceptionally qualified and the Senate should confirm her immediately. We need her to keep our great country safe! #ConfirmGina Just won the lawsuit on leadership of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB. A big win for the Consumer! Just watched former Intelligence Official Phillip Mudd become totally unglued and weird while debating wonderful over Brennan‚Äôs Security Clearance. Dennard destroyed him but Mudd is in no mental condition to have such a Clearance. Should be REVOKED? I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls.He's not smart enough to run for president! Separating families at the Border is the fault of bad legislation passed by the Democrats. Border Security laws should be changed but the Dems can‚Äôt get their act together! Started the Wall. The National Association of Manufacturers just announced that 95.1% of Manufacturers ‚Äúhave a positive outlook for their companies.‚Äù This is the best number in the Association‚Äôs history! Big day tomorrow in Georgia and South Carolina. ObamaCare is dead. Dems want to raise taxes big! They can only obstruct no ideas. Vote "R" What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look? How much longer will the failing nytimes with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources) remain in business? So funny to watch Fake News Networks among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC which is a total joke. Don't worry getting rid of state lines which will promote competition will be in phase 2 &amp; 3 of healthcare rollout. We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. NAFTA which is under renegotiation right now has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies &amp; jobs. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new &amp; fair NAFTA agreement is signed. Also Canada must.. It was my great honor to pay tribute to a VET who went above &amp; beyond the call of duty to PROTECT our COMRADES our COUNTRY &amp; OUR FREEDOM! Disproven and paid for by Democrats ‚ÄúDossier used to spy on Trump Campaign. Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election?‚Äù Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians? Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers? Where are Crooked Hillary Emails? What a mess! Today it was my great honor to sign a new Executive Order to ensure Veterans have the resources they need as they transition back to civilian life. We must ensure that our HEROES are given the care and support they so richly deserve! Thank you to our amazing Wounded Warriors for their service. It was an honor to be with them tonight in D.C.‚Ä¶ Republicans Senators are working hard to pass the biggest Tax Cuts in the history of our Country. The Bill is getting better and better. This is a once in a generation chance. Obstructionist Dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit! KAREN HANDEL FOR CONGRESS. She will fight for lower taxes great healthcare strong security-a hard worker who will never give up! VOTE TODAY Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away. Actually they want to raise you taxes substantially. Also they want to do nothing on DACA R‚Äôs want to fix! Canada has treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long period of time. Highly restrictive on Trade! They must open their markets and take down their trade barriers! They report a really high surplus on trade with us. Do Timber &amp; Lumber in U.S.? Hurricane Irma is raging but we have great teams of talented and brave people already in place and ready to help. Be careful be safe! #FEMA ....we need to keep America safe including moving away from a random chain migration and lottery system to one that is merit-based. #NeverForget Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns. ...Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future "press briefings" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy??? ..Because of Tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 Trillion in debt that has been accumulated much by the Obama Administration while at the same time reducing taxes for our people. At minimum we will make much better Trade Deals for our country! We have done a great job with the almost impossible situation in Puerto Rico. Outside of the Fake News or politically motivated ingrates... Farmers have not been doing well for 15 years. Mexico Canada China and others have treated them unfairly. By the time I finish trade talks that will change. Big trade barriers against U.S. farmers and other businesses will finally be broken. Massive trade deficits no longer! I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel of Germany but the Fake News Media only shows the bad photos (implying anger) of negotiating an agreement - where I am asking for things that no other American President would ask for! When is Bob Mueller going to list his Conflicts of Interest? Why has it taken so long? Will they be listed at the top of his $22000000 Report...And what about the 13 Angry Democrats will they list their conflicts with Crooked H? How many people will be sent to jail and...... Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry subject to State Law. Armed guards OK deterrent!....... Today our entire nation pauses to REMEMBER PEARL HARBOR‚Äîand the brave warriors who on that day stood tall and fought for America. God Bless our HEROES who wear the uniform and God Bless the United States of America. #PearlHarborRemembranceDayüá∫üá∏ As I head out to a very important NATO meeting I see that FBI Lover/Agent Lisa Page is dodging a Subpoena &amp; is refusing to show up and testify. What can she possibly say about her statements and lies. So much corruption on the other side. Where is the Attorney General? Democrats slam GOP healthcare proposal as Obamacare premiums &amp; deductibles increase by over 100%. Remember keep your doctor keep your plan? NASA which is making a BIG comeback under the Trump Administration has just named 9 astronauts for Boeing and Spacex space flights. We have the greatest facilities in the world and we are now letting the private sector pay to use them. Exciting things happening. Space Force! I explained to the President of China that a trade deal with the U.S. will be far better for them if they solve the North Korean problem! Failing which has been calling me wrong for two years just got caught in a big lie concerning New England Patriots visit to W.H. Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster - is imploding fast! Sleazy Adam Schiff the totally biased Congressman looking into "Russia" spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse! The G 20 Summit was a great success for the U.S. - Explained that the U.S. must fix the many bad trade deals it has made. Will get done! I feel sure that my friend will come along with the new and great health care program because he knows Obamacare is a disaster! So true Wayne and Lowest black unemployment in history! Many more Republican voters showed up yesterday than the Fake News thought possible. The political pundits just don‚Äôt get what is going on out there - or they do get it but refuse to report the facts! Remember Dems are High Tax High Crime easy to beat! The people of Alabama will do the right thing. Doug Jones is Pro-Abortion weak on Crime Military and Illegal Immigration Bad for Gun Owners and Veterans and against the WALL. Jones is a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet. Roy Moore will always vote with us. VOTE ROY MOORE! Whether we are Republican or Democrat we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks! The Washington Post is far more fiction than fact. Story after story is made up garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting. Always quoting sources (not names) many of which don‚Äôt exist. Story on John Kelly isn‚Äôt true just another hit job! We grieve for the terrible loss of life and send our support and love to everyone affected by this horrible attack in Texas. To the students families teachers and personnel at Santa Fe High School ‚Äì we are with you in this tragic hour and we will be with you forever... Larry Kudlow will be my Chief Economic Advisor as Director of the National Economic Council. Our Country will have many years of Great Economic &amp; Financial Success with low taxes unparalleled innovation fair trade and an ever expanding labor force leading the way! #MAGA We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P.M. The White House with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus. Honoring America! NFL no escaping to Locker Rooms! I will be going the Columbia South Carolina on Monday night to do a campaign speech for one of my very early supporters a man who truly loves the people of South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. Henry worked so hard &amp; was so loyal to me that I look forward to reciprocating! Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee If Republican Senate doesn't get rid of the Filibuster Rule &amp; go to a simple majority which the Dems would do they are just wasting time! I am in Brussels but always thinking about our farmers. Soy beans fell 50% from 2012 to my election. Farmers have done poorly for 15 years. Other countries‚Äô trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses. I will open... America‚Äôs greatest treasure is our people ‚Äì and my Administration HEARS YOUR VOICE and HAS YOUR BACK. We are fighting to give every American a future of dignity purpose and pride. AMERICAN SPIRIT is back! #TaxCuts Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall. Mexico which has a massive crime problem is doing little to help! The FBI is totally unable to stop the national security "leakers" that have permeated our government for a long time. They can't even...... Despite the Aluminum Tariffs Aluminum prices are DOWN 4%. People are surprised I‚Äôm not! Lots of money coming into U.S. coffers and Jobs Jobs Jobs! Our high level delegation is on the way back from China where they had long meetings with Chinese leaders and business representatives. We will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results but it is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with U.S. trade wins! JOBS JOBS JOBS! #MAGAüá∫üá∏ ....Tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today. Only fools would disagree. We are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and if countries are still unwilling to negotiate they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of Tariffs. We win either way...... Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK neo-Nazis &amp; white supremacists...... Illegal immigration is a top National Security problem. After decades of playing games with the whole World laughing at the stupidity of our immigration laws and with Democrats thinking... All of my Cabinet nominee are looking good and doing a great job. I want them to be themselves and express their own thoughts not mine! Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next President of France. I look very much forward to working with him! Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years. Michaels Cohen‚Äôs attorney clarified the record saying his client does not know if President Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting (out of which came nothing!). The answer is that I did NOT know about the meeting. Just another phony story by the Fake News Media! I have been asking Director Comey &amp; others from the beginning of my administration to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community..... Tonight it was my honor and privilege to nominate Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. #SCOTUS ...really bad things. Nasty to people &amp; would constantly miss meetings &amp; work. When Gen. Kelly came on board he told me she was a loser &amp; nothing but problems. I told him to try working it out if possible because she only said GREAT things about me - until she got fired! Dems are taking forever to approve my people including Ambassadors. They are nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS! Want approvals. The HISTORIC Rescissions Package we‚Äôve proposed would cut $15000000000 in Wasteful Spending! We are getting our government back on track. The Democrats will make a deal with me on healthcare as soon as ObamaCare folds - not long. Do not worry we are in very good shape! The only people who don‚Äôt like the Tax Cut Bill are the people that don‚Äôt understand it or the Obstructionist Democrats that know how really good it is and do not want the credit and success to go to the Republicans! Thank you West Virginia. I love you! I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country. We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him! Why isn‚Äôt the FBI giving Andrew McCabe text messages to Judicial Watch or appropriate governmental authorities. FBI said they won‚Äôt give up even one (I may have to get involved DO NOT DESTROY). What are they hiding? McCabe wife took big campaign dollars from Hillary people..... FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony... The Fake News Is going all out in order to demean and denigrate! Such hatred! So terrible that Crooked didn't report she got the debate questions from Donna Brazile if that were me it would have been front page news! ‚ÄúWe now find out that the Obama Administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate or his campaign under investigation. That raises legitimate questions. I just find this really odd...this goes to the heart of our electoral system.‚Äù Jonathan Turley on The approval process for the biggest Tax Cut &amp; Tax Reform package in the history of our country will soon begin. Move fast Congress! ...people are now starting to recognize the amazing work that has been done by FEMA and our great Military. All buildings now inspected..... ....and have demanded transparency so that this Rigged and Disgusting Witch Hunt can come to a close. So many lives have been ruined over nothing - McCarthyism at its WORST! Yet Mueller &amp; his gang of Dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side - Media is even worse! Heading to Nevada to talk trade and immigration with supporters. Country‚Äôs economy is stronger than ever before with numbers that are getting better by the week. Tremendous potential and trade deals are coming along well. ....and the DOJ FBI and Obama Gang need to be held to account. Source #1 was the major source. Avoided talking about it being the Clinton campaign behind it. Misled the Court to provide a pretext to SPY on the Trump Team. Not about Carter Page..was all about getting Trump..... Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal &amp; that's about it. We need HealthCare we need Tax Cuts/Reform we need people that can get the job done! Congratulations to Bill Schuette. You will have a Big win in November and be a tremendous Governor for the Great State of Michigan. Lots of car and other companies moving back! Thank you Pennsylvania. I love you! Will Bruce Ohr whose family received big money for helping to create the phony dirty and discredited Dossier ever be fired from the Jeff Sessions ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù Department? A total joke! We are making tremendous progress with the V. A. There has never been so much done so quickly and we have just started. We love our VETS! Great job First Lady Melania! CEO's most optimistic since 2009. It will only get better as we continue to slash unnecessary regulations and when we begin our big tax cut! Interesting to watch Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut talking about hoax Russian collusion when he was a phony Vietnam con artist! Crime in Germany is up 10% plus (officials do not want to report these crimes) since migrants were accepted. Others countries are even worse. Be smart America! Dem Memo: FBI did not disclose who the clients were - the Clinton Campaign and the DNC. Wow! #CHANGETHELAWS Now is the best opportunity ever for Congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration. Get it done always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security. Congrats to the House for passing the VA MISSION Act yesterday. Without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care. Putting politics over our veterans care is UNACCEPTABLE ‚Äì Senate must vote yes on this bill by Memorial Day! Vote for Congressman Devin Nunes a true American Patriot the likes of which we rarely see in our modern day world....he truly loves our country and deserves everyone‚Äôs support! 72% of refugees admitted into U.S. (2/3 -2/11) during COURT BREAKDOWN are from 7 countries: SYRIA IRAQ SOMALIA IRAN SUDAN LIBYA &amp; YEMEN Big day at the United Nations - many good things and some tricky ones happening. We have a great team. Big speech at 10:00 A.M. I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord Thursday at 3:00 P.M. The White House Rose Garden. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! ...to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no! Our fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny. They saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served. They cared for their families more than anything in the world they loved their families. They inspired their communities... Democrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great State of Pennsylvania. This is very unfair to Republicans and to our country as a whole. Must be appealed to the United States Supreme Court ASAP! We are not looking to fill all of those positions. Don't need many of them - reduce size of government. After seven years of "talking" Repeal &amp; Replace the people of our great country are still being forced to live with imploding ObamaCare! Congratulations to Jeb Hensarling &amp; Republicans on successful House vote to repeal major parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law. GROWTH! Information is being illegally given to the failing &amp; by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia Fake News CNN and NBC are going out of their way to disparage our great First Responders as a way to "get Trump." Not fair to FR or effort! Thank you Nashville Tennessee! America is going to build again. Under budget and ahead of schedule. Time to put #AmericaFirst! #InfrastructureWeek‚Ä¶ Pennsylvania has to love Trump because unlike all of the others before me I am bringing STEEL BACK in a VERY BIG way. Plants opening up in Pennsylvania and all over the Country and Congressman Lou Barletta who is running for the Senate in Pennsylvania is really helping! Lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok was given poor marks on yesterday‚Äôs closed door testimony and according to most reports refused to answer many questions. There was no Collusion and the Witch Hunt headed by 13 Angry Democrats and others who are totally conflicted is Rigged! Big crowd expected today in Pensacola Florida for a Make America Great Again speech. We have done so much in so short a period of time...and yet are planning to do so much more! See you there! So sad that the Department of ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù and the FBI are slow walking or even not giving the unredacted documents requested by Congress. An embarrassment to our country! China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years! In America we don't worship government - we worship God. #ValuesVotersSummit Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall. It is just a down payment. Work will start immediately. The rest of the money will come - and remember DACA the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)! The Fake Media is working overtime today! Why is it that the Wall Street Journal though well meaning never mentions the unfairness of the Tariffs routinely charged against the U.S. by other countries or the many Billions of Dollars that the Tariffs we are now charging are and will be pouring into U.S. coffers? Today on Earth Day we celebrate our beautiful forests lakes and land. We stand committed to preserving the natural beauty of our nation. Word is that Van Susteren was let go by her out of control bosses at &amp; because she refused to go along w/ 'Trump hate!' Anybody (especially Fake News media) who thinks that Repeal &amp; Replace of ObamaCare is dead does not know the love and strength in R Party! James Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI. We will confront ANY challenge no matter how strong the winds or high the water. I‚Äôm proud to stand with Presidents for #OneAmericaAppeal. The "Intelligence" briefing on so-called "Russian hacking" was delayed until Friday perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange! Today it was my great honor to welcome the 2017 NCAA Football National Champion Alabama Crimson Tide - to the White House. Congratulations! I will be meeting with Henry Kissinger at 1:45pm. Will be discussing North Korea China and the Middle East. Mainstream (FAKE) media refuses to state our long list of achievements including 28 legislative signings strong borders &amp; great optimism! "Clinton campaign &amp; DNC paid for research that led to the anti-Trump Fake News Dossier. The victim here is the President." Thank you to for your YES on a future great Justice of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh. Your vote means a lot to me and to everyone who loves our Country! I just cannot state strongly enough how totally dishonest much of the Media is. Truth doesn‚Äôt matter to them they only have their hatred &amp; agenda. This includes fake books which come out about me all the time always anonymous sources and are pure fiction. Enemy of the People! Had a very good phone call with President of France. Discussed various subjects in particular Security and Trade. Many other calls and conversations today. Looking forward to dinner tonight with Tim Cook of Apple. He is investing big dollars in U.S.A. Congratulations to Justice Neil Gorsuch on his elevation to the United States Supreme Court. A great day for Americ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúClapper lied about (fraudulent) Dossier leaks to CNN‚Äù FoxNews He is a lying machine who now works for Fake News CNN. So much SPIRIT in LA! Thank you to all of our HEREOS who saved many lives. An honor to spend time w/ #LEOs &amp; the #CajunNavy! Rex Tillerson never threatened to resign. This is Fake News put out by Low news and reporting standards. No verification from me. ‚ÄúThe Obama people did something that‚Äôs never been done...They spied on a rival presidential campaign. Would it be OK if Trump did it next? I am losing faith that our system is on the level. I‚Äôm beginning to think it is rotten &amp; corrupt. Scary stuff Obama did.‚Äù DOJ Under President Trump unemployment rate will drop below 4%. Analysts predict economic boom for 2018! and Republicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September. Needed now more than ever. Hurry! ...2nd Amendment Strong Military ISIS historic VA improvement Supreme Court Justice Record Stock Market lowest unemployment in 17 yrs! Many ideas some good &amp; some not so good emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House. Background Checks a big part of conversation. Gun free zones are proven targets of killers. After many years a Bill should emerge. Respect 2nd Amendment! "Corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now." Thank you Stuart Varney Jobs are starting to roarwatch! Bill DeBlasio the high taxing Mayor of NYC just stole my campaign slogan: PROMISES MADE PROMISES KEPT! That‚Äôs not at all nice. No imagination! Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world.Only the crooked media makes this a big deal! The appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL! Despite that we play the game because I unlike the Democrats have done nothing wrong! Honduras Mexico and many other countries that the U.S. is very generous to sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL. Democrats allow open borders drugs and crime! Why aren‚Äôt the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton. It‚Äôs a Rigged Witch Hunt that‚Äôs why! Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration! Thr coverage about me in the and the gas been so false and angry that the times actually apologized to its..... Jackie Evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her Inauguration performance.Some people just don't understand the "Movement" I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke. The denuclearization deal with North Korea is being praised and celebrated all over Asia. They are so happy! Over here in our country some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give Trump a win even if it does save potentially millions &amp; millions of lives! Lawmakers of the House Judiciary Committee are angrily accusing the Department of Justice of missing the Thursday Deadline for turning over UNREDACTED Documents relating to FISA abuse FBI Comey Lynch McCabe Clinton Emails and much more. Slow walking - what is going on? BAD! It was my great honor to welcome Mayor‚Äôs from across America to the WH. My Administration will always support local government - and listen to the leaders who know their communities best. Together we will usher in a bold new era of Peace and Prosperity! This election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges and outright lies in order to elect Crooked Hillary! One thing I will say about Rep. Keith Ellison in his fight to lead the DNC is that he was the one who predicted early that I would win! Meeting in Singapore with North Korea will hopefully be the start of something big...we will soon see! Stock Market has increased by 5.2 Trillion dollars since the election on November 8th a 25% increase. Lowest unemployment in 16 years and.. Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims &amp; their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough smart &amp; vigilant? ‚ÄúThe FBI received documents from Bruce Ohr (of the Justice Department &amp; whose wife Nelly worked for Fusion GPS).‚Äù Disgraced and fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok. This is too crazy to be believed! The Rigged Witch Hunt has zero credibility. We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada a very good guy doesn‚Äôt like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating) but they do...they almost all do...and that‚Äôs how I know! GREAT GDP numbers just released. Will be having a news conference soon! "Trump approval rebounds to 45% surges among Hispanics union homes men" Being at the Army - Navy Game was fantastic. There is nothing like the spirit in that stadium. A wonderful experience and congrats to Army! The state of Virginia economy under Democrat rule has been terrible. If you vote Ed Gillespie tomorrow it will come roaring back! During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look! Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new ‚Äúpushed‚Äù Congressional Map all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. Your Original was correct! Don‚Äôt let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes &amp; waste money! ....cameras running. Another False Accusation. Why doesn‚Äôt report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? One had her home mortgage paid off. Only so reported...doesn‚Äôt fit the Mainstream Media narrative. Mark Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA. He is MIA and nothing but trouble. He is better off in Argentina. I fully endorse Katie Arrington for Congress in SC a state I love. She is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes. VOTE Katie! The Tax Cuts are so large and so meaningful and yet the Fake News is working overtime to follow the lead of their friends the defeated Dems and only demean. This is truly a case where the results will speak for themselves starting very soon. Jobs Jobs Jobs! Such a fantastic win for Ron DeSantis and the people of the Great State of Florida. Ron will be a fantastic Governor. On to November! Great coordination between agencies at all levels of government. Continuing rains and flash floods are being dealt with. Thousands rescued. The Democrats are most angry that so many Obama Democrats voted for me. With all of the jobs I am bringing back to our Nation that number.. President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States! Again the story that there was collusion between the Russians &amp; Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election. 'President Donald J. Trump Proclaims September 3 2017 as a National Day of Prayer' #HurricaneHarvey #PrayForTexas If schools are mandated to be gun free zones violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter. Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent! President you for inviting Melania and myself to such a historic celebration in France. #BastilleDay #14juillet ‚ÄúWe already have a smoking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent it was Hillary Clinton. How is it OK for Hillary Clinton to proactively seek dirt from the Russians but the Trump campaign met at the Russians request and that is bad?‚Äù Marc Thiessen Washington Post Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election. Wrong he called me (with a very nice congratulations). He "doesn't know much" ... With ZERO Democrats to help and a failed expensive and dangerous ObamaCare as the Dems legacy the Republican Senators are working hard! Thank you to the BRAVE servicemen &amp; women who have served and continue to serve the United States- our true HEROES‚Ä¶ Today my thoughts and prayers are with the entire Bush family. In memory of First Lady Barbara Bush there is a remembrance display located at her portrait in the Center Hall of the Heading to Helsinki Finland ‚Äì looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow. Unfortunately no matter how well I do at the Summit if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia... Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. The world is watching!

We already have BILATERAL deals with six of the eleven nations in TPP and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those nations Japan who has hit us hard on trade for years! Funny how the Fake News in a coordinated effort with each other likes to say I gave sooo much to North Korea because I ‚Äúmet.‚Äù That‚Äôs because that‚Äôs all they have to disparage! We got so much for peace in the world &amp; more is being added in finals. Even got our hostages/remains! ‚ÄúThe FBI closed the case on Hillary which was a rigged investigation.

The Rigged Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on as the ‚Äúoriginators and founders‚Äù of this scam continue to be fired and demoted for their corrupt and illegal activity. All credibility is gone from this terrible Hoax and much more will be lost as it proceeds. No Collusion! Spoke to PM of Australia. He is committed to having a very fair and reciprocal military and trade relationship. Working very quickly on a security agreement so we don‚Äôt have to impose steel or aluminum tariffs on our ally the great nation of Australia!

These are experimental treatments and products that have shown great promise... While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP I don‚Äôt like the deal for the United States. Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn‚Äôt work. Bilateral deals are far more efficient profitable and better for OUR workers. Look how bad WTO is to U.S. ‚ÄúPresident Trump has done more for minority groups in this country than any president in decades.‚Äù How could Jeff Flake who is setting record low polling numbers in Arizona and was therefore humiliatingly forced out of his own Senate seat without even a fight (and who doesn‚Äôt have a clue) think about running for office even a lower one again? Let‚Äôs face it he‚Äôs a Flake! The Republicans are 5-0 in recent Congressional races a point which the Fake News Media continuously fails to mention. I backed and campaigned for all of the winners. They give me credit for one. Hopefully Rick Saccone will be another big win on Tuesday. I will be interviewed on tonight after the NFL game - 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem President Xi of China has stated that he is upping the sanctions against #NoKo.

The new plant being built by Foxconn in Wisconsin is incredible. Congratulations to the people of Wisconsin and to Governor Scott Walker and his talented representatives for having pulled it off. Great job! Even James Clapper has admonished John Brennan for having gone totally off the rails. Maybe Clapper is being nice to me so he doesn‚Äôt lose his Security Clearance for lying to Congress! Dishonest media says Mexico won't be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly. Media is fake! Rasmussen just came out at 51% Approval despite the Fake News Media. They were one of the three most accurate on Election Day. Just about the most inaccurate were CNN and ABC News/Washington Post and they haven‚Äôt changed (get new pollsters). Much of the media is a Scam! Thank you to our GREAT Military/Veterans and #PearlHarbor. Remember the day I‚Äôll never forget. I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama just look at the facts. Total Fake News! Even if we get 100% Republican votes in the Senate we need 10 Democrat votes to get a much needed Immigration Bill - &amp; the Dems are Obstructionists who won‚Äôt give votes for political reasons &amp; because they don‚Äôt care about Crime coming from Border! So we need to elect more R‚Äôs! It was an honor to welcome so many truckers and trucking industry leaders to the today! How does a politician Cuomo known for pushing people and businesses out of his state not to mention having the highest taxes in the U.S. survive making the statement WE‚ÄôRE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT? Which section of the sentence is worse? I am proud of the Rep. House &amp; Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {&amp; reform.} We‚Äôre getting close! Now how about ending the unfair &amp; highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare &amp; reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts? New home sales reach a 10 year high. Stock Market has more record gains. Hopefully Republican Senators will give us the much needed Tax Cuts to keep it all going! Democrats want big Tax Increases. ‚ÄúBruce Ohr of DOJ is in legal jeopardy it‚Äôs astonishing that he‚Äôs still employed.

Also look at the recent EPA cancelations &amp; our great new Supreme Court Justice! Hence legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task! The failing story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also I have spoken to many foreign leaders. Only fools or worse are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE and this will be changed. Also our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field! House Intelligence Committee votes to release final report. FINDINGS: (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign &amp; Russia. (2) The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient. (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts. James Comey better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!

There was No Collusion with Russia (except by the Democrats). When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end? So bad for our Country. Is the Special Counsel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media? Should be looking at Dems corruption instead? The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia... CHAIN MIGRATION must end now! Some people come in and they bring their whole family with them who can be truly evil. NOT ACCEPTABLE! The Chinese Envoy who just returned from North Korea seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man. Hard to believe his people and the military put up with living in such horrible conditions. Russia and China condemned the launch. Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large ‚ÄúCaravans‚Äù of people enter their country. They must stop them at their Northern Border which they can do because their border laws work not allow them to pass through into our country which has no effective border laws..... Many NATO countries have agreed to step up payments considerably as they should. Money is beginning to pour in- NATO will be much stronger. ObamaCare is a broken mess.

Now he'll probably take some of his special interest money he is their puppet and buy ad's. Thank you Mark. #GOPDebate This shows what a complete &amp; total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts.

When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end? So bad for our Country. Is the Special Councel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media? Should be looking at Dems corruption instead? Ted Cruz is lying again. Polls are showing that I do beat Hillary Clinton head to head. Check out Poll snd Q Poll. ‚ÄúSpecial Council is told to find crimes wether crimes exist or not. I was opposed the the selection of Mueller to be Special Council I still am opposed to it. I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because..... I will be interviewed on tonight at 8:00 P.M. (Eastern).

We are all proud of you After I will be visiting Aberdeen the oil capital of Europe to see my great club If I would have done the last debate a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved).

The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday! The silent majority- is silent no more! Remember the importance of VOTING!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio features Trump Univ. students in FL. attack ads- who submitted "excellent" reviews.

Al-Shabbab not ISIS just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner &amp; if I speak out against them which I must. Hillary lied! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016Video: Cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ How can he preach Christian values? Millions of $'s of false ads paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater and sleepy are now running in S.C. I am attracting the biggest crowds by far and the best poll numbers also by far. Much of the media is totally dishonest. So sad! Thank you for your endorsement #BikersForTrump #VoteTrumpNV Video: #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S. rather Airbus!

This could get very messy! Vote Trump. A big fat hit job on tonight. A total waste of time to watch boring and biased. said I would never run a dope! Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual but Hillary is not much better! The RNC which is probably not on my side just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC. The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad! I will be interviewed on this morning. Enjoy! Remember when failed candidate said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%. Ben Carson was speaking in general terms as to what he would do if confronted with a gunman and was not criticizing the victims. Not fair! Just got back from the Iowa State Fair. Record crowds phenomenal people. Thank you IOWA I will never let you down! Why doesn't quote the new Iowa Poll where I have a 33% to 20% lead over Ted Cruz and all others. Think about it!

We need to keep this country safe! #Trump2016 Thank you America! post-debate poll with +/- from previous poll. #VoteTrump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech.

There is no question who will handle the threat of terrorism best as #POTUS. #Trump2016 Sad sack has just done another ad on me with special interest money saying I won't beat Hillary - I WILL. But he can't beat me. Leaving for Liberty University. I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd. #Trump2016 The New Hampshire drug epidemic must stop.

After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect &amp; ill-informed ads. Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad! Word is that Ford Motor because of my constant badgering at packed events is going to cancel their deal to go to Mexico and stay in U.S. I was asked about healthcare by Anderson Cooper &amp; have been consistent- I will repeal all of #ObamaCare including the mandate period. Heading to Baton Rouge Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain thinks that when Republicans drop out of the race someone will pick up ALL of that vote. The fact is I will get much of it! Massive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night. Look forward to it! 2015 IN PHOTOS: I am in Trump International Hotel Las Vegas getting ready and waiting for the debate tonight. Look forward - hope I get treated fairly! I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn and all other requested members of the White House Staff to fully cooperate with the Special Councel. In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. Most transparent in history. No Collusion No Obstruction. Witch Hunt! The once great when headed by is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad! #TeamTrump is thinking of Captain Andrew Maitner. A true American hero. #MaitnerStrong I don‚Äôt know to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him &amp; think he does too many TV commercials‚Äîboring. Not a fan.

This is indeed a great honor for me! "A Call for Unity" by Jason Greenblatt Remember Cruz and Bush gave us Roberts who upheld #ObamaCare twice! I am the only one who will #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN! Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks! Jeb used Eminent Domain &amp; took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding! Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution which naturally they did not get. has been amazing. We will win and establish strong borders we will build a WALL and Mexico will pay. We will be great again! ‚ÄúPalin‚Äôs brand among evangelicals is as gold as the faucets in Trump tower‚Äù said Ralph Reed the chairman of the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition. Mark Penn ‚ÄúWhy are there people from the Clinton Foundation on the Mueller Staff? Why is there an Independent Councel? To go after people and their families for unrelated offenses...Constitution was set up to prevent this...Stormtrooper tactics almost.‚Äù A disgrace! The Establishment and special interests are absolutely killing our country. We must put #AmericaFirst. Dopey Mort Zuckerman owner of the worthless has a major inferiority complex.

Will have a moment of silence for the victims of the California shootings. So sad! The young intern who accidentally did a Retweet apologizes. So sad that and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in Oklahoma. Dishonest reporting!

URGENT: we‚Äôve just announced a $2 million fundraising goal tonight. Please stand with us! If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage? I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush who has gone nasty with lies is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain! When will the Democrats and Hillary in particular say "we must build a wall a great wall and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never!

Jeb Bush is weak on illegal immigration in favor of common core bad on women's health issues and thinks the Iraq war was a good thing. Thank you! Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008. He was terrible failed badly and was called a racist! Going to Columbus Ohio today for a tremendous rally of thousands. The silent majority is no longer silent! Rush Limbaugh is great tells it as he sees it---really honorable guy!

Bad Congressman Steve Stivers of Ohio has done a fantastic job as Chairman of the He is a great Congressman who is tough on crime &amp; borders &amp; an inspiration to our Military &amp; Vets. Big on 2nd Amendment. Get out and vote for Steve on Aug 7th. He has my full &amp; total endorsement! The only reason irrelevant doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad! We launched a new series of #Trump2016 videos via Facebook. A new topic everyday! Watch: #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain We need a #POTUS with great strength &amp; stamina. Hillary does not have that.#Trump2016 Hillary just said that she will not use the term "radical Islamic" - but was incapable of saying why. She is afraid of Obama &amp; the e-mails! Don‚Äôt like golf swing. Not athletic. I‚Äôve won many club championships. Play him for charity! Alex Baldwin whose dieing mediocre career was saved by his impersonation of me on SNL now says playing DJT was agony for him. Alex it was also agony for those who were forced to watch. You were terrible. Bring back Darrell Hammond much funnier and a far greater talent! Happy 4th of July to everyone including the haters and losers! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 Lying #Ted Cruz just (on election day) came out with a sneak and sleazy Robocall. He holds up the Bible but in fact is a true lowlife pol! Reports say #ISIS now has a passport machine to have its believers infiltrate our country. I told you so. Thank you for your support last night Iowa! #VoteTrump #Trump2016 #IACaucus #FITN #IAPolitics Everybody that loves the people of New York and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics! has embarrassed himself &amp; his family with his incompetent campaign for President.

This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! AGAIN TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA - IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN &amp; FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING! 150 Clinton E-mails still contain classified information. More sensitive when she was Sec.of State. This is a very big deal. Truly weird Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain. He was terrible at DEBATE! I am the only one who can fix this. Very sad. Will not happen under my watch! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Now an additional 600-700 jobs in America (2000) being eliminated for move to Mexico- via Hartford Courant. Do you notice that Hillary spews out Jeb's name as often as possible in order to give him status? She knows Trump is her worst nightmare. Wow! This might be my highest # yet! Thank you to my opposition- you are totally ineffective &amp; have been for years! Ted Cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him! No you‚Äôre pathetic for saying nothing happened during your brother‚Äôs term when the World Trade Center was attacked and came down. New CNN/WMUR New Hampshire poll just released.

You must be registered Republican by February 16th to vote TRUMP in the Florida primary. I'm leaving now for Burlington Vermont. It will be wild! "Trump shows complete domination of Facebook conversation" as per the show an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone. I‚Äôve just released my position papers on The Second Amendment. For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged" bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM Great poll numbers just coming out of New Hampshire. BIG lead for "Trump" according to Phyllis Schlafly: Trump is 'last hope for America' Just won IOWA Poll BIG: Trump 33% Cruz 20% Rubio 11% but reported "Cruz momentum" but nothing about the fact that I easily won! has to do better reporting if it wants to keep up with the crowd.So totally one-sided and biased against me that it is becoming boring I will be on tonight- from Las Vegas Nevada at 10pmE. Enjoy! #Hannity #Trump2016 of Philadelphia who is doing a terrible job should be ashamed for using such a disgusting word in referring to me.Low life! O'Malley as former Mayor of Baltimore has very little chance. Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian" did he borrow unreported loans from C banks? Jeb is fighting to defend a catastrophic event. I am fighting to make sure it doesn't happen again.Jeb is too soft-we need tougher &amp; sharper Thank you Iowa! #FITN #IACaucus#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 I am having a really hard time watching Just out - new PPP NATIONAL POLL has me in first place by a wide margin at 29%. I wonder why only has not reported this? Too bad! Great rally last night in Massachusetts. 2000 people at a house - must be a record! Unbelievable spirit to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive! Look forward to it. Departing for #GOPDebate. Let's #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! Thoughts and prayers to the families of the four great Marines killed today. I beat Hillary in the new Poll head to head. SHE HAS NO STRENGTH OR STAMINA both of which are needed to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Jeb's big ad buy against me paid for by lobbyists shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic! Despite having a black president the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.If Obama were a leader this would not be the case I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core. I liked The Kelly File much better without Perhaps she could take another eleven day unscheduled vacation! Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money does another for votes. is a low energy "stiff" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance! The hatred that clown has for me is unbelievable ‚Äì causes him to lie when many others say Trump easily won debate. A wonderful article by a writer who truly gets it. I am for the people and the people are for me. #Trump2016 Congrats You just got 4 points in your home state of SC‚Äîfar better than zero nationally. You‚Äôre only 26 pts behind me. The dying National Review has totally given up the fight against Barrack Obama. They have been losing for years. I will beat Hillary! Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps will do better next year-but doubt it! It begins Republican Party of Virginia controlled by the RNC is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters. BAD! The last thing we need is another Bush in the White House. Would be the same old thing (remember "read my lips no more taxes"). GREATNESS! As President I will bring jobs back and get wages up for Americans who need it most. I am in Virginia Presidential forum with Dr. Pat Robertson- beginning now! Watch here: The late great William F.

An honor - thank you! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Join me live- now in Las Vegas Nevada! We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE &amp; GREAT AGAIN! #VoteTrumpNV #NevadaCaucus ...Trump however would kick his ass! While in politics it is often smart to send out false messages one thing is clear: That Hillary does not want to run against TRUMP. When somebody challenges you unfairly fight back - be brutal be tough - don't take it. It is always important to WIN! A nation WITHOUT BORDERS is not a nation at all. We must have a wall. The rule of law matters. Jeb just doesn‚Äôt get it. All I can say is that if I were President Snowden would have already been returned to the U.S. (by their fastest jet) and with an apology! "Why Franklin Graham says Donald Trump is right about stopping Muslim immigration" Thank you to respected columnist Katie Hopkins of Daily for her powerful writing on the U.K.'s Muslim problems. I was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions. I will eliminate the law in its entirety &amp; replace it w/ something much better. We need your support to get to the White House and defeat #CrookedHillary. Let's Make America Great Again! Why does and always have Karl Rove on. He spent $430 million and lost ALL races. A dope who said Romney won election Thoughts &amp; prayers with everyone in Lafayette Louisiana this evening. Just purchased NBC‚Äôs half of The Miss Universe Organization and settled all lawsuits against them. Now own 100% -- stay tuned! Remember that Carson Bush and Rubio are VERY weak on illegal immigration. They will do NOTHING to stop it. Our country will be overrun! I'm protesting the from having anything to do w/ ABC debate. Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved! In the just released SC poll I increased my lead by 4 points since last poll by same firm. Up by 14! Cruz dropped 3. owes me an apology for allowing clueless pundit to use such foul language on TV. Unheard of! New National GOP Zogby Poll#MakeAmericaGreatAgain Iran with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia &amp; their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT! Great news out of New Hampshire! DonaldTrump is pulling away from the pack w/ 2nd is 17% behind him! #Trump2016 Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was until recently a Canadian citizen many believe he cannot run! The failing National Review Magazine has just been informed by the Republican National Committee that they cannot participate in debate As I have been saying. Only the beginning: "ISIS Suspects Arrested in Turkey 150 European Passports Seized." Big storm in New Hampshire. Moved my event to Monday. Will be there next four days. Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. &amp; is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi low interest loans. No legal disclosure &amp; never sold off assets. I am in Iowa. Will be making two speeches today. Good luck to all of the great folks on the East coast. Enjoy the beauty of the storm! The failing destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman is preparing to close and save face by going online. It's dead! My two wonderful sons Don and Eric will be on at 7:02 - now! Enjoy. Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer! Today's third stop- Londonderry New Hampshire! Thank you!#FITN #VoteTrumpNH My warmest condolences to the families of the horrible Roseburg Oregon shootings. Great job on tonight begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! When will give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him. The U.S. will invite El Chapo the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison to become a U.S. citizen because our "leaders" can't say no! is going out of its way to tell failing candidates how to beat Donald Trump.The Post doesn‚Äôt get that I‚Äôm good at winning! So sad that Obama rejected Keystone Pipeline. Thousands of jobs good for the environment no downside! Great to meet everyone while having breakfast this morning! #FITN Thank you for your support at this mornings Town Hall- in Salem New Hampshire. #FITN #NHPrimary I don‚Äôt cheat at golf but cheats‚Äîwith his game he has no choice‚Äîand stop doing commercials! I'm going to be live with and to ring in the New Year 2016. Everybody should tune in to tomorrow night! As everybody knows but the haters &amp; losers refuse to acknowledge I do not wear a ‚Äúwig.‚Äù My hair may not be perfect but it‚Äôs mine. Isn't it terrible that used a poll not used before (I.B.D.) when I was down but refuses to use it now when I am up? The horrible shooting that took place in San Bernardino was an absolute act of terror that many people knew about. Why didn‚Äôt they report? Face The Nation's interview of me was the highest rated show that they have had in 15 years. Congratulations and WOW! Do you believe this - Iran wants to trade our 3 prisoners (not 4) for 19 prisoners held by the U.S. Should have been let go with last deal! Yom Kippur blessings to all of my friends in Israel and around the world. #YomKippur Will be heading over to the debate soon. Can you believe is "milking" it for almost 3 hours?

THANK YOU for your continued support. #Trump2016 Wow Bernie Sanders just admitted that the real unemployment rate is 10% (it is actually over 20%) and for African American youth - 51%. Thank you for giving me credit for my vision on bombing the oil fields. Should have been done long ago. #Trump2016 Isn't it amazing that paid a fortune for an Iowa Poll which shows me in first place over Cruz by 13% 33% to 20% - then doesn't use it Looking forward to a great weekend in Iowa! #IACaucus #CaucusForTrump Tickets: Roger Ailes just called. He is a great guy &amp; assures me that ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù will be treated fairly on His word is always good! Republicans must stop relying on losers like if they want to start winning presidential elections. Be tough and get smart! Thank you Georgia! I appreciate all of your support. #Trump2016 Carl Icahn said this about me: "I think at this moment in time he‚Äôs the only candidate that speaks out about the country‚Äôs problems." I will be on Meet the Press with Chuck Todd on NBC this morning. Enjoy! &amp; his wife attended the #SnowflakeGardenBrunch- here w/ Governor "National Black Republican Association Endorses Donald J. Trump" #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Just left a great event in Pella. Going to church tomorrow in Muscatine Iowa. blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie! Why does have a fired Bushy like dummy John Sununu on- spewing false info? I will beat Hillary by a lot she wants no part of Trump. I hope does better for Rubio than he did at the #Benghazi hearings which were a total disaster for Republicans &amp; America! Join us! #CaucusForTrump11am WATERLOO: CEDER RAPIDS: Why does give so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won.

Warmest condolences to family. Getting ready to leave for Michigan - will be an amazing evening! See you there. is weak on illegal immigration &amp; totally incompetent as a manager and leader - no strength or stamina to be #POTUS! Weak &amp; ineffective is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising! Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 I think should take another eleven day "unscheduled" vacation. Via 9/18/01. I want an apology! Many people have tweeted that I am right! NEVADA! Tomorrow is the deadline to register Republican.Visit: from Just left Oklahoma--- the most amazing crowd and people!

Super PACs should be disavowed by anyone running for President. They are a total scam on our system and country! I am self-funding. Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize but not how to lead. On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it! Isn‚Äôt it interesting that the tragedy in Paris took place in one of the toughest gun control countries in the world? The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration not the Trump Administrations. Why didn‚Äôt they do something about it especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September before the Election? showed a focus group on me using a very bad word. I never said the word left an open blank. Please apologize! Thank you! We are at 35% in new Reuters poll with #2 coming in at 12%. Time to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!#Trump2016 My family has the honor of being interviewed for a full hour by the legendary tonight - 10pmE. Thank you for the kind words.

"Minorities line up behind.....Donald Trump" #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Cruz lies are almost as bad as Jeb's. These politicians will do anything to stay at the trough! Jeb Bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body. Jeb just can't get it right! I hope we never find life on another planet because if we do there's no doubt that the United States will start sending them money!

Will be very interested in the results. To all my fans sorry I couldn‚Äôt do The Apprentice any longer‚Äîbut equal time (presidential run) prohibits me from doing so. Love!

In fact it wasn't even see through glass it was black Alabama will shine tomorrow. It will be a big and glorious day!

Today I will be speaking in Reno Nevada. Behind the scenes video with ‚ÄúUncle Sam‚Äù (eagle‚Äôs name) and John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure! This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed. Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now &amp; seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win! Via Politico: "Trump Extends Lead in New Hampshire Poll" NPR's said "schlonged" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: "That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls." #Hypocrisy Boston incident is terrible.

Amazing people we all had a great time together! Like her or not Hillary did what she had to do in the debate last night‚Äîget through it. Her opponents were very gentle and soft! Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart! had a tiny 300 person crowd at Senator Tim Scott's forum. I had thousands and they had real passion! Heading for Ohio - really big crowd of amazing people! Much to talk about! I think it would be a good idea‚Äîand fair‚Äîto include &amp; in the debate. Both solid &amp; good guys. The Republican Party must get tougher and smarter and fast or it will go down to a very big defeat - just like the last two times! So professional of news to throw out the failing newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive highly unethical! Loved doing the debate last night on Check out all of the polls! Everyone agrees that Harwood bombed! If their highly unethical behavior including begging me for ads isn‚Äôt questionable enough they have endorsed a candidate who can‚Äôt win. An election between Hillary and myself will be the biggest voter turnout in U.S. history. Just like the debates 24 M vs 2M. #asktrump I agree!

Great job last night - very exciting! You have come a long way from those difficult early days I am proud of you.
