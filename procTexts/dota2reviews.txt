You learn how to learn, how to lose and most importantly you learn about you. Alright. so here is my dota review after playing almost hours over the span of years. general thoughts and how i started I was when a friend recommended dota to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that saying nothing is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional s. Did i waste my youth? So this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but careerschoolwise i highly doubt that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts lets learn music or lets study wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of improving wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that. time invested into dota EVERY dota player that has spent more than hours into this game has had that thought of oh man i shouldve learned something with this time. i couldve been amazing now. at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota is that spending s of hours is something you do with pleasure. Its kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for school again i realized how much ing time hours is. I garantue you that you will be a top student if youd put hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING. REWARDING dota is IGN REWARDING. you learn a new hero BAMM MMR. you start understanding how to farm M M R YOUR RANK GOES IGN UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this yeargrades are OKkinda good, not great. ReasoN I WROTE THIS im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY ed up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do CONCLUSION AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUNif you are competetive. Skipped classes thanks to Dota. Learned to gamble thanks to Dota. Learned to swear in different languages thanks to Dota. Became racist thanks to Dota. All in all, Ruin your life simulator. would recommend if you are trying to kill yourself. Cancer can be cured, Dota community cant be. Imagine, for a moment, that it is Christmas morning. Your home is abuzz with laughter, and the smell of fresh baked goods drifts up from downstairs. You race to the tree, and begin to open a beautiful present, adorned with festive colors and a wrapping scheme that is both dauntingly complex yet also simple in its execution. You turn to your mother, father, and two siblings and smile for you know that your adventure into opening your gift is about to begin. You go to open your unwrapped box, and BWONG. A horn bellows, deafening you. Out of the box pops a small, dwarflike figure, wielding a multicultural bat festooned with Ecuadorian and Peruvian patterns, and of Russian construction. THANKS FOR STANDING STILL, GANKER, he shrieks, as he wallops young brother Timmy in the teeth. Your mother tuts and scolds him, for being out of position. The dwarf darts under the tree, looking for a hole in the wall to continue his pursuit of ratDOTA. Gank him, your father roars, as he sits on the couch lazily and watches. You crawl, desperate for your gift of victory over the rat, under the tree, and he continues to elude you. Suddenly, with a flourish, he produces a lighter, and proceeds to methodically burn down your house while muttering GG EZ, and your family sits in the living room muttering garbage team and reported. Your family home burns down around them, and only you escape the engulfing flames, accompanied by the chortles of the dwarf. Downtrodden but not easily bested, you begin your walk down the street to your friends house, in the hopes that by having Christmas at their house, you might be able to somehow catch the multicultural dwarf on the second try. Best fun and Peruvian simulator. This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers. Then it taught me to hate them all. good game. This game taught me that friends are very important, because Im not gonna play on a team with four random thats for sure. Its like roulette fun until it turns into Russian. God bless anyone that dares to enter in this cesspool of toxicity. Made my family think i got some kind of mental illness. In Dota Not many people speak your language. Not many people play well. Not many people talk nicely. Not many people work as a team. But if you find people that do. Youll have the most fun youve ever had. If you are worried your children are doing drugs, show them this game. They will be too busy fulfilling their innermost masochistic desires while hopelessly right clicking that they will not have the time for drugs or friends or anything else really. THE PUB SUPPORT Where are wards? The pub Carry demanded. I placed them and they were countered the Support began, I am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm, protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more, also possibly sentries to remove their UP COUR PLS the mid hero politely added. Give Savle The Carry demanded. Certainly. replies the support, using the salve on the Carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave. So where is mek? the Carry said, after he was ganked due to overextending. The Support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse. Again, having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards, I dont think a minute Mek is viable. The Support replies. Haha look your level, so low, noo the Carry retorted. U have no item xaxa. Well, jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which I attempted to give you, the carry, the priority over. The Carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower, oblivious to the enemy tp that the Support moved away from. Report Support, usless The carry cried in allchat, in between mentioning various aspects of the Supports Mothers anatomy. Instead of reporting and acting like that, why dont you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry? the Support asked, as he watched the Carry return to afklasthitting lane creeps. HAH, support is for noskill noobs like you!. ive only played this game for hours and the friendly community has already begun to teach me russian greetings such as c and Great Russian language simulator. So many diffrent heroes and diffrent builds that you can do compared to all the other Mobas in the market. If your looking for a moba to really stick your teeth into and learn lots this is it. Great Game! Been playing it since and still one of my favourite game of all time!. In this game you can Murderer trees Kill an ancient creature chilling in his cave without mercy and and steal his cheese Learn at least different languages in every single match Kill others players for no apparent reason Can develop erectile dysfunction due to extended seated hours.

This game allows you to exert your knowledge and understanding of layered mechanics and exceptions of those game mechanisms onto randomlyselected regional people without their permission or interest. Heated debates can lead to forged alliances to achieve that common goal or end into displaced frustration projected onto others to substitute ones own failures and inabilities to execute ones characters heroes qualities. On the other hand, this game allows one to create hero build guides as a pretense to be productive with hisher vexation as well as to fruitlessly raise the standard of expected knowledge of the game through item and ability walkthroughs in hopes that those one encounters in the future, rely on these indirect, serviced suggestions. Imagine youre playing a game with a few friends and youre having fun. You exchange jokes and high fives all around after every epic moment. Your bro turns to you and says, I love this game, and I definitely do not want to kill myself! You all laugh. You are having a good time. You are not playing Dota Dota where do I start. This game has ruined my social life, I spend every day on this game, training, waiting, and drinking through my mountain dew, to one day become the greatest. My father said to me, Son, you will never be dondo. I said to my father, Dad, I mid, or I feed. My dad dropped to the ground in tears, screaming at the all mighty gabe newell, begging for his son back, but it was too late, I was already back on dota, at mid, blaming my team for sucking This game is why I wake up, Why I masturbate, why I decide that masturbating while playing is a good idea. Thank you for such an amazing game, without this game I would have nothing to get mad at when I am rock solid. I got addicted to this game very easily! How can you not with such great features like Get abused by friends Learn to abuse your friends No matter what language setting you provide you still will be a Feel slightly racist towards Russains A loving comunity that just thinks you need to practice more so therefor uninstal dota u noo, play botz or report invoqerr he feed If it was a minute close game always remember to write EZ GAME GG NOOBS You instantly get a few cool nicknames when you play dota, feeder, noob, and lots more Learn how to get self esteem issues, anxiety and if youre lucky even deppression This game is great, and with such a fantastic comunity you know youre going to enjoy every moment of it.

Ive punched more holes in my wall then you could imagine playing this game. recommend. game including updates community including myself Quit playing. Try to be a better person. I only play Dota when I feel like killing myself. Before playing this game I thought Brazillians were only bad at soccer. When I was young, I started to suffer from a major crack addiction. This was becoming a real problem. after telling a friend about my struggle with narcotics, he suggested I played this crazy game called DOTA I spent some of my crack money on a new computer so I could play this game. The more I played, the more it started to attract me. In the end, I realised that this game was a much healthier substitute to crack cocaine. I gave up crack last year, never looked back. Now I waste my life away playing DOTA instead. Saved my life. In this game you can Murderer trees Kill a ancient creature chilling in his cave without mercy and and steal his cheese Learn at most different languages in every single match Kill others players for no apparent reason Can develop erectile dysfunction due to extended seated hours. This is yet another new release by the company MOBA you may know this company from their popular games such as League of Legends, Dead island Epidemic and Dawngate. This is a very slow paced first person shooter set in the age after the rd great war in which humanity has been set back in the ages where magic was still okay to use, in this game you play as an ex soldier trying to defeat the main communist overlord sniper who threatens america as we know it. The single player aspect of this game is probably the best experience youll have in this game as the online is currently dead, the developers stopped updating this game after league of legends was confirmed to be more balanced and a hell of a lot better. They did however unlock a new game mode called Compendium in which you simulate reading a book and collect trading cards. Ill give this game meepos out of its okay but the fact that youre required to be able to speak russian to get this game really lets it down. Dota is sequel to critically acclaimed hat trading sim, Team Fortress What Valve has managed to do with hats is astounding. Theyve improved upon everything that the original had to offer, and then they kicked it up a notch. Imagine a world where everyone and every thing has a hat. Now imagine that you can become THAT hat. You are the weapon, you are the bullet, you are the sword edge. Thats immersion on a new level. Never before has an experience been this good. I recommend this to anyone who has ever, or will ever dream of hat, hats, or hat accesories. If you havent yet, you need to experience this. Go do it. Now. Hats, its all right. Update I havent touched this game in years and theres a reason for that Im too busy wearing and showing off my hats. Great hats. Ruined my life. Told my friends. It ruined their life too. stars. update Learnt how to swear in russian and philippines, Report Simulator Commend beggars everywhere, You can eat a tree to gain health. Its basically the best thing ever. This game has made me racist towards those who speak any language other than english. Would buy again. I Became calm person in real life because of this game. Ive tried Rosetta Stone, duolingo, and even college classes, but nothing has taught me Russian or Brazilian better than this! And its free!. The first time you play you will have a very unpleasant experience and most likely uninstall the game. Within a few days, however, youll feel an urge to play it. Youre going to watch videos of pro people teaching you how to play, and youre going to think that now youre really good. Youre wrong. Over time, however, things will get better, and youll actually start winning. Then, you start losing again, but this time its not your fault its your teams fault. Always remember that NOTHING is EVER your fault. Your dumbass antimage was complaining that you were stealing his farm, but its your farm dammit! Then pudge is getting butthurt about losing lane because he never had a flying courier, when the real reason he lost is because he didnt give you unit control when you are clearly a better pudge! Meanwhile the enemy team is getting fed because your teamates never backed you up when you blitzkrieged in v, and they even have the nerve to question your methods! Then you notice that your dumbass antimage is in the jungle farming because he couldnt farm in lane. You know, however, that he is just a noob. Eventually the enemy is pushing your tier s, and the game is obviously over. This is the time when you give up and sit in base. Ignore the fact that your team has won the last two teamfights and you are starting to catch up, its better if you just quit now. While youre waiting in base, make sure that the enemy team knows that you are not at fault in your loss. Make sure you type in allchat team noo followed up by report antimage. If they ask why you want them to report him, ignore them, if your team has the bodacity to try and defend themseves, repeatedly say phrases such as lol ur so bad and ur just mad cuz you cant play. You could also take the alternative route and say things like and Yea, the game and communtiy can be a sometimes, but its also a super fun game that requires fast paced decision making as well as strategical analysis. Plus, it unifies gamers and conservatives by creating one common hatred Russians. All in all, this game is getting and feeling like youre on top of the world, but that makes you feel sooooo good that it keeps pulling you back. You awaken in a cold room. You are naked, and shivering. Looking up from your bed of damp straw, you can just make out what seems to be the Peruvian flag hung from the celing. There is a pistol on a small table near by. For some reason, you are drawn to it. It calls to you like a sirens song. You put it in your mouth, the gunmetal tastes so sweet. The last words you hear, echoing through the chamber REPORT NOOB MID HIJO DE NO GANK. i am still waiting for the tenth player confirm. One day, a wise man intoduce me into this game. it shall protect your virginity, my lad he said. Its like crack. When its good its good, and when its bad its still pretty good. I can be a tree. Highly recommend. I have been playing this game for miserable years and m wrinting this review as an advice. To whom it may concern. Uninstall this game and run for your life before its too late. Maybe the reader now giggling and drawing an image on hisher mind says this guy is a nerd. No im not, Im a fitness guy with good shape studying engineering, which I had a social life in the past I lost too much things on my life most of them are privacypersonal things not going to write them down but one of them is my education years old still studying engineering because of this game. If you are going to say that you can manage your day between playing DOTA and studying or working you are wrong because the average match time is min only match. So min games per day min. Not mentioning that some games exceed hour if both teams played well. Please take this as an advice from years old guy who has been suffering for years because of this game I sucked on education you can be better than me and quit, I destroyed my dream and now im trying to bring it back wish me good luck. Please this is not a joke post and this advice aiming on teenagers who want to achieve their future dreams just dont play this game its in AWESOME game but you have to pay your life for it. Your choice life or Dota and this is not a joke if you throw my words away just please save my comment on your favorites and come back after years dont cry if your life got ruined. Save my comment if you dont want to take my advice you can visit this comment again. Most of positive reviews are written by Valves agents believe me. When I started playing Dota I didnt know any Russian, now Im Vladimir Putin. A better language learning software than Rosetta Stone. would recommend. best way to learn russian. Most fun way to commit social suicide and learn Russian. When I first started DOTA I was a little overwhelmed, as my first ARTSMOBA game it was pretty complicated. I soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying. Before I knew it, I was performing and better. I stopped making silly and got vastly better at not the enemy For the part, everyone Ive met was very helpful and there the however. As play DOTA !. DotA Will drain you of your will to keep playing, and yet you will always return. DotA Will make you regret ever playing it, and yet you will always think Just one more game DotA Will take away all your free time, and yet youll almost feel proud of how many hours you have in DotA With the time you spend on this game, you could do all sorts. Study on learning a new set of skills to further your career. You could raise money for charity. You could be an aid worker for a foreign country and help improve the lives of others. You could even just play other games, you know, those ones sitting in your backlog, pushed aside by DotA But you wont. You will always return to this game. The maximum you will learn from playing this game is how to insult others in various languages mostly these languages will consist of Russian and Peruvian.. This game will become as much a part of your life as eating or blinking. Half the time you will not even remember having played DotA on a certain day. It just becomes natural to you. If you start playing this game, you become addicted. You will also spend obscene amounts of money on cosmetics. A quick chest purchase here, a few random items on the market there, and boom. Like me youll have spent far too much on a game which needs no money spent on it. If you start DotA not only will you be subjecting yourself to a motivationdestroying hobby, but also subjecting yourself to a wallet emptying one too. tldr This game will take away your time, money and patience for others. You will become an angry person. Basically GOTY All years. Ive always wanted to go to Russia. To learn the culture, eat and drink and see the sights. But I cannot do that, as it is expensive and Im busy doing my uni work. But then I found Dota This free learning course teaches you all about Russians and their culture. I can even speak decent Russian! However, these Russian people can get quite angry and annoying. They often shout the phrase and bring you to the depths of insanity. I got forced to drink my sorrows away during the beginning of the course, but it was worth it in the end. If you dont have the time and money to travel to Russia, Id suggest you pick up Dota A fantastic learning resource. This game sucks, you cant even jump. I have over hours and I want to kill myself. Thanks icefrog!. i had a life before i played dota, it ruined my college life after i played dota, i lost my girlfriend bcoz of dota, i gained weight bcoz of dota, i lost my job bcoz of dota, now i am selling my stuff on market bcoz i know i play dota, i want to leave dota but i cant escape playing dota, hours on my account and i still want to play dota, my beard is big as hell bcoz i play dota, i want to quit,but i cant quit dota, its all true, bcoz it ruined my life bcoz i play dota, Its and i still want to play dota, But i have to stop it now but i still i want to play dota, I have health problems bcoz of dota,but still i want to play dota, This is not life but still i want to play dota, I cant have sex bcoz i am fat but still i want to play dota, I tried to be Hindi Caster for India and it Lusts me to play dota, But its High Time and I Have to Quit Dota, I am Finally Deleting this game without backup but my heart still wants dota!! Last But Not Least SO IF U WANT A LIFE,JUST STOP PLAYING DOTA!!. How most of my solo ranked match goes Find match, wait for all people to load up Marked middlelane on my minimap A dude on my team Mid or feed Be a bigger man and give him mid, then i mark safelane Other dude Im gonna carry, trust me, give me safelane Sigh, Mark hardlane and say Im going offlane then Another guy pick BristleBack and said Just let me offlane OMGWTFBBQ Picking support, being a solo support Working my off stackin camps, buying wards, assisting on lanes Have no items because few assist and didnt take any creeps Lose miserably Team said GG NOOB SUPPORT NO HELP AT ALL !! MMR Get Migrane, cries in the shower would solo ranked again !. Just like realtime chess, but everyone is a queen. Some queens shoot lasers, some summon huge Golems and some sing so hard your eardrums burst. Dota is definitely one of the best games of this generation, and Im certain it will remain as popular and as influnencal for many years to come. Graphics Very pretty, the art direction in DotA is one of the best. The source engine ensures you can run it on anything more powerful than a toaster, and have it look great too. Cosmetics look great, and fit perfectly, with some exceptions,Im looking at you Alpine Ursa but many stay true to the heros artstyle. Sound All heros have a multitude of voice lines,and some even respond to one another e.g Tidehunters hatred for Kunnka. If you find the default anouncer not too flash, theres a huge variety of optional packs, from the smoth talking Narrator from bastion, to the harsh condescending tone of Pyrion Flax. Gameplay The big one. Theres a reason DotA Allstars got so popular, not just from the incredible passsion from the community, or the dedication of IceFrog and co., but from the incredible gameplay that spawned one of gamings most popular genres. From perfectly coordinating a fountain hook, to getting stuck on top of a cliff accidentally as Storm Spirit, no other genre rivals DotA outstanding strategic gameplay and nearvertical learning curve. At the time of writing, I have hours played and Ive only just scratched the surface in the combos, stratagy and availble heros to use, it takes year of hard work, dedication and passion to become truly great at the strategical masterpeice that is Dota beardATTACK fren. Thank goodness I wasnt a virgin before I started playing this otherwise I still would be. Best rts original DotA strategy game ever. mid or meepo. If youre masochistic and enjoy listening to people cuss you out in Portuguese, Spanish, and Russian, you should play. Make sure to set your server settings to US West, US East, and preferred language to English to get the best PortugueseSpanishRussian experience. DOTA is the best in the MOBA class. Ive played LoL, DOTA and some lesser known MOBAs and DOTA is by far the best. In addition, it is FP which is amazing. Unlike LoL or HoN which require you to use a rotating hero list until you buy your own with real money or accumulate enough ingame currency to buy a single hero, DOTA immediately gives you access to its entire library of heroes, for free. The only paid content are cosmetical items that do not change gameplay. Graphics are great. Gameplay is great. Crashes are very minimal. ITS FREE. As a guy that started playing DotA back in take my words that youll only be trully able to enjoy this game if you totally dedicate yourself to learn and get better at it in other words, youll need a lot of TIME to actually enjoy the game. DOTA is a very competitive game, where teamwork is everything, and unfortunately a lot of players dont actually care or know about that, and thus making the game a rather difficult experience, especially for new players. New player advice Read as much as you can on the internet about DOTA,watch videos, watch tournaments, get as much help as you can.Starting fresh new in a game that has an audience this big with a lot of experienced players is tough, since the majority of the players that will be on your team will expect you to know the game. As a new player you would expect the game to put in a team with other new players, right? Well DOTA system doesnt work like that, even if youre a new player, theres still a chance that youll get in a team with someone who has hours in the game, this games evaluates you in WINrate, and any new account has a rather high Win rate, so it ends up putting you with very experienced players even if they are considered bad, you most likely wont get in a bracket with ONLY new players. As for playing the game, I would advise you to NEVER play SOLO ranked before actually knowing a huge part of the game, you can play NORMAL matchmaking or even PARTY with your friends, but never actually try to get a SOLO rank, without knowing the game youll most likely get a very low rank and its really, really hard to climb from there, so dont make this mistake. Keep in mind this game has a huge community and with that theres a big part of it that consist in toxic players, so its very common for players in game to start a flamewar and ruin the experience, the best thing to do is open scoreboard and mute those people, this game needs you to be focused on the actual game rather than the people in the chat arguing with each other, even if it means muting all of your teammates, I always say this to my friends just mute himthem but they never listen and ends up getting frustrated with the raging guy, dont let those kind of people ruin your game. Best advice for me is, try to be as POLITE as possible, even if youre playing bad, try to get ideasadvices ingame from your teammates like What Item should I get for my hero?, saying My bad or Sorry everytime you do something wrong is also good, it makes people understand that you know you did something wrong and they might start helping you ingame. Dota is like a black hole. It sucks in your time, energy and chance of getting laid. But its fun to spin around in. I never thought I would spend so much lifetime in a game that makes me want to kill myself every time I play it. Please, send help. I learned to hate people Ive never met. Ruined my life, and made me fail school. ruined my life! best game DOTA Play at your own risk. almost died from heart attacks. a friend tried to kill me in real life. i lost my job. my girlfriend left me. spent too much money on hats, now im bankcrupt. gain too much weight from playing and eating junk food would waste my life again. If youre looking for a League of Legends clone, look elsewhere if youre looking for a MOBA that you can play for a couple weeks or even months and become good at, look elsewhere. Ive been playing Dota for around years since it was DotA, the Warcraft III custom map and Ill tell you right now theres still a lot of room for personal improvement. This game boils down to far more than individual skill, tactics, and teamworkcooperation. The author of Three Lane Highway see pcgamer.com has called Dota an isometric wizardem up game, and I think its fitting. There are so many aspects to this game, so many factors that control the outcome that if you try and sit down and list them all itll take you a couple hours. And youll still miss some. I have played pretty much every single Multiplayer Online Battle Arena on the market, and no matter how interesting they are or what different elements they try to bring to the gameplay, I always end up coming back to Dota. If you want to seriously challenge yourself, and you have the will and motivation to work towards a lofty goal that many are unable to reach, this is the game for you. set server region to Europe West language preference English only find a match realise that people in your match are russians get reported by them for PICKING riki quit Rating ca. Great game. k Hours. Hard to learn. Impossible to truly master. So many possibilities and variables. Teamwork crucial. Time consuming games can be mins long. Watch is great too. Personally Am trying my best to play a lot less because of life responsibilities. Suggest watching rather than playing if you are time poor. Some players can be toxic ie. Rude or angry. Suggest muting them for an enjoyable experience. Made me learn russian to better communicate with my fellow russian comrades. Well Played! This game protects my real life virginity. The Real Dota Dota is a competitive game of action and strategy, played both professionally and casually incompetently by millions of enslaved passionate fans Russians worldwide. Players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes carries, forming two teams of five players five feeders. Radiant heroes then battle their Dire counterparts to control a gorgeous fantasy landscape, waging campaigns of cunning, stealth, and outright warfare raging in an unknown language and teamfighting with one RAMPAGE victor. Irresistibly colorful on the surface addictive, Dota is a game of infinite depth and complexity which requires, no, infact takes an infinite amount of your life away. Every hero has an array of skills and abilities that combine with the skills of their allies in unexpected ways, to ensure that no game is ever remotely alike that allow players to screw with their allies and get their teams killed. This is one of the reasons that the Dota phenomenon has continued to grow Dota will have more rage quitting and all chat abuse than any other game. Originating as a fanmade Warcraft modification, Dota was an instant underground hit. After coming to Valve, the original community developers have bridged the gap to a more inclusive Link NOTE Original description by Valve, edited by myself. how the do you play this. This game is such a ripoff of Mario Party After being a part of dota community since when it was not as toxic as it is now i am really sad to give this game a bad review. Not because of gameplay or Community. But for the automated report system this game has which is broken and is abused by kids on the regular. Community as toxic as it is which gives no regards to u but themselves should not be given the priviledge to report someone over false acusations not when the system is automated and the reports that they make are just taken in count never reviewed. This creates a lot of possibilities as people can report u for playing good and o believe me they will. Today it has come to this point where people are being reported for not sucking in game and are sent to low priority no matter what the cause as cause doesnt really matter when its not looked into. As a dota fanatic i would say this game is a masterpiece even with the community as toxic as it is if u know how to handle it. But if that community is given the power to shove random people into low priority for no real reason i think its high time i leave steam as a whole because they dont understand how the gaming world works and their support are monkeys on the keyboard As i think Valves new Employees are a bunch of kids as well. First twenty hours playing this game, got called NOOB for so many times that i went down to my basement and cried daily Second twenty hours playing this game, joined others and called the new guy NOO to avoid being called NOO Third twenty hours playing this, I finally got the courage to call others NOO all by myself Fourth twenty hours playing this game, I finally became mature enough to stop with all the NOOB bs and started to give advice to the other players from atop my mighty throne Overall, DOTA is an addictive, competitive MMO whose community precedes its reputation, almost everyone is downright selfish, everyone only wants more kills to sate their hunger for commendations, which they even beg for. The trick to enjoying it though start playing with friends or people you know, make a plan, help your teammates, and CHOOSE A SUPPORT IF YOU SEE THERE ARE NONE and reach level and you can play ranked matches, where the people are not much friendlier but will at least help you out. EDIT oh and always remember to uncheck Russia when selecting servers why no reason, just thought i should say that GODLIKE GAME someone kill it you will get this reference after playing the game Still good in When in a game, if someone type this words putang ina, bobo, ako mid. Leave the match, dont ever ask why, just do it. This is an important message for everyone, leave the match. When Bloodseeker gets above a certain move speed he should make Race Car noises.

Fortunately if youre looking to learn foreign swear words, this is definitely the game for you. would cry again. I used to play LoL, and sunk more money into that game than I care to admit. The great thing about DotA, is EVERY hero is unlocked from the start. LoL has a limited selection of free champions every week, which is fine, but your options are limited during drafting. I found myself buying champs that were popular in the current meta just to compete. I havent played LoL in months since getting into DotA, how can I? This game is so much more complex which is daunting at first, but the more you learn and play the better it gets. Every day I learn something new, I try a new hero or two, and its awesome. Highly recommend checking out httpwww.reddit.comrlearndota as well as httpdota.gamepedia.comDotaWiki httpwww.devilesk.comdotaappsinteractivemap is a great map. I may have spent more time watching gameplay vidsstrats and tournaments than actually playing the game! The in game spectating client is very well done, it even has casters! LoL is just. lol! It doesnt compare. Causes anxiety problems, low self esteem, Tourettes syndrome, mood swings, Bipolar disorder, breakdown of relationships, raging erections, racism. Would definetely recommend. Now take my ramen you Its the best. if you have too much friends, and you whant to loose some. This game ruined my life I recommend everyone to play Dota and not LoL nor HoN. Dont get me wrong, I am not hating or anything. I was from HoN for like years before Dota was released and tried LoL and actually enjoyed it for a bit but then went back to HoN. Dota is a great game, an awesome game. I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say. Mechanics are well designed, what makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. This is a team game people, so team work is a must unless you are solo queuing, then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around. Monster gamers are real. Dota has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday, and that. This game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds. A mere game that brings people together, not just friends but complete strangers too. Dota is a game that will never be forgotten. All in all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better. P.S. Calm down, its just a game. ruined my life. I dont know how many times I have uninstalled this game. Hello am year man from somalia. Sorry for my bad englando.

Soviet Simulator According to this game, Russians live everywhere except for Russia itself. Makes you racist towards Russians and if it doesnt do that then youre probably Russian yourself.

Racism per second Version changelog Edits Version Racism per second Rps from Rps to Rps. Gameplay Graphic Community updated, people see this wrong and keep asking me. I wrote negative Playing with friends Competitivenessbalance INTRO For those of you who arent familiar with the MOBA genre, heres a quick explanation. There are two bases, each on opposing corners of the map, and one for each team. The objective is to destroy the opposing teams base. Three roads, or lanes, connect the bases. Lowlevel units automatically and periodically spawn from each base in groups, and these soldiers travel down the three paths between the bases. As a result, there is always a battle going on in the trio of lanes. In addition, each team has three defensive towers in each lane on their side of the map, totaling nine towers per team. These structures deliver powerful attacks against enemy soldiers and players, but they can be destroyed through significant effort. Because of this, fights tend to center on the towers. All of this happens automatically. Unlike in typical RTS games, you dont have to collect resources, build structures, or train units. You only control your hero, which can level up and acquire a range of upgradeable powers. However, its role might best be described as support for the A.I. soldier units. Players help control the battlefronts and destroy enemy towers in the lanes. The idea is to to open your opponents base up to a direct attack by the A.I. and hero once the towers in a lane are gone. There are five players per team, which of course doesnt divide into the three lanes equally. When a player dies, he respawns at the teams base after a penalty period. ProCon PROS All At Your Fingertips players have access to ALL of the games heroes from the start. No need to unlock or purchase heroes. poor LOL Snowball Easily dying results in a loss of gold, can magnify the effects of snowballingBuyback system can make sure you dont lose a game with just one mistake.

When Putin invades the Ukraine and World War starts, this game will be the reason why so many people from all around the world will gladly pick up arms against the Russians. Hi. I only recommend you this game if you love MOBAs, but I didnt like MOBAs and now I have hours in it. I was a COD player, an MW player. Of course you will not be pro in your first matches. To be good you need a lot of training. If you played LoL and you have lvl its sure you know the basics. In this game the most important thing is the Last Hitting at the start, because if you have more gold and XP than your enemy, you own the game. The game may be boring, but if you have friends it wont be. I think the boring part is the first lvl because you cant play some gamemodes before that. If you are new here you need to complete the training! If you are totally new here completing the training will get you a Sniper set. No the setts doesnt give you any bonus, just the enemy can see how rich you are. These decorative items have degree Common, Uncommon, Rare, Mythical, Immortal, Old and Arcane. This items can be Normal, Auspicious, Heroic, Cursed and Unusual. So these were the decorative items lets talk about the ingame items! You start with gold each hero have their own item build. I recommend you the Healing Slave, Tango and clarity items, this items will fill your HP or your mana. If you are new or never played that hero before i recommend you the guides Up left the book icon. I recommend you the builds or builds. Thank you for reading this review. PDHungarianDotAfan. Dear Boys Girls! The most fantastic game that improves skillset used in everyday life! After a couple of hours I already got the hang of the game. It is a real rewarding piece with a beautiful community that is keen on helping you improve and unleash your hidden potential. Even though Ive achieved the highest Badge possible in the game which is also a great and original idea to somewhat categorize players, I am still reminded daybyday that Im pretty new to the game and I should focus on polishing my skills, which is a huge help since I am somewhat a maximalist. The Dev Team is amazing and fast to reply in cases of bugs, broken things throughout the game that would otherwise alter the potential outcome of important Ranked Matches. I would highly recommend it to people thinking about taking up a semester abroad or such since it does help You enourmously when it comes to foreign languages. After just years I was fluent in Russian and Spanish even though I have never taken a class before and this allowed me to travel to St Petersburg and Barcelona taking my language skills to the next level. Its easy to make friends, people have no prejudice when it comes to your Badge, Divine highest rank in the system players play with Heralds lowest rank in the system and enjoy spending some free time with their fellow bratushki. I would also like to thank Valve for the amazing support towards amateur and semiprofessional teams, the sponsoring of various national tournaments all over the globe and the ability to connect with each other in real life through this amazing franchise. The game rewards You trying really hard to win games and works on pushing you even further. The higher your impact in games, the lower impact people it will match with you, resulting in you having to push even harder. Amazing! Understand people from all over the globe through simple words, hieroglyphs, and ancient text. Being able to acquire and share information in a new and intuitive way. Some people take the role of the good soldier and some that of the leader. With Power however comes Great Responsibility. You are ready to make calls and lead your team towards victory? Keep in mind that you will also be accounted for the consequences of a miscall. But in the end you will become more daring and even better at leading with example! The more you play the more advanced you become and analysis, prediction and understanding of movement and thoughts of people you have never met before. Paired with your glorious Communication Skills you will be able to share and respond to any situation. You will effectively be able to see the future as it is! While most games are circa minutes long, in some games you spend a wonderful hrs time together with other nice people who you learn to know during this experience. The longer the game lasts however, the harder it becomes since any small mistake you make can be the end of the struggle. You acquire the ability called Laser Focus eyes on the goal, maximum efficiency, error factor. High level players have iron nerves! As human beings we must understand that sometimes we win and sometimes we learn. After lost games we still are eager to learn from our mistakes, commend the people that accounted for the win on the opposing team and pat the weaker players on the back. Standing up after a failure is a key factor in creating something new, in evolving. DotA is a major enhancement in this area. Give it a try, enjoy your time and who knows we might meet in game! Cheers,. Imagine yourself trapped in a sewer swimming around eating nothing but turds your entire life, each turd represents an average public game. Now imagine after all of those turds you go to eat the another one and to your surpise it is a chocolate bar, it is the best feeling in the world. That chocolate bar represents those occasional games where everyone is evenly skilled and tastes so good that you continue eating turds just hoping for that next chocolate bar. this game ruined my life. I learnt how to insult people in russian. Dota then MMR is just a number Dota now MMR is just a medal. Much worse than any drug out there and it ruined my life. This game cured my erectile dysfunction. xaxaxaxaxaxaxaxa. Playing this game on US East made my Spanish grade rise from a B to A. Best language learning tool. I really like this game. It was the first MOBA ive ever played, and I love it. It was hard at first, but the more I played it i got and better. I think what really helped people that helped me along Sure, fair share of bad apples, I would played it. So, here are some limericks about Dota that may help you decide whether to play or not. Sorry in advance There once was a man named zeus His team put him mid on the loose He could totally But had no escape and so he got ganked like a moose One time Pugna I tried to play But forgot that there is no way To get more than five health Without massive wealth And bounty hunter stuck his peepee in my bum over and over and over and I cried Sometimes if there is a dragon You need to purchase a dagon And then you go ZAP And all cross the map People made the excuse they were laggin Nyx nyxnyx nyx nyxnyx nyx Nyxnyx nyx nyxnyx nyx nyx nyx Nyx nyx nyx nyx Nyx nyx nyx nyx nyx Nyxnyx nyx nyxnyx nyx nyx nyx There once was a brave little feller Who wanted to be the best speller But he was russian And people are s So now he lives in a cellar There once was a brave little a bear Who smoked into Roshans lair So hard he tried But he got bashed and died And now his team is giving him the glare If you play dota beware Because its sometimes a pit of dispair Advice you will heed But your teem will still feed And then you will switch to solitair So I just wasted a solid minutes making jenky limericks about dota. Just play the game, its awesome. I fail my exams, I almost lost communication with my family and friends.became lifeless and reached k hours on Dota and still have no regrets. would die playing for this game. FYI this game is worst than drugs. Once you get in, your never coming back. Good game I only played it for a little bit. Its ok I guess. russian language simulator. This game made me think one thing. If you dont speak English you dont deserve a computer. Hourly reminder to stay hydrated, bros. Report Player Simulator Best Play Games with Russians simulator Ive ever played. Dota community is seriously the best Ive ever seen for my entire life. Theyre so concerned with us players to the point that they ask are you blind, are you stupid? Never in my life have Ive seen someone who asked me such thing, it touched my heart. Theyre legit concerned that if Im blind and stupid, probably they want to take me to the hospital if I really am. They even suggest to delete the game as Im playing it too much! Best!. You STUN NOW!!!! Teammates Supporting in dota is like chemistry If its easy youre doing it wrong. You should buy some hats. I think players of this game keep sharing my mothers private number, everyone seems to have had sex with her. Oh yea and about the game.Very good. Really great game. If you love racing games that focus on realism and physics, this is the game for you. Has over cars to race with. Usually a man race to the finish. Alot better then Forza. Causes anxiety problems, low self esteem, Tourettes syndrome, mood swings, Bipolar disorder, breakdown of relationships, raging erections, racism. Would definitely recommend. Thought you liked Russians? Hahahahahahahahahahaha!. I dont want to play again with russians. would sooka again. while the rest of you picked carry my eyes became teary i bought that donkey i bought those wards tangos and branches are all i got i did those pull i did those deny but wtf you just died the mid pudge wants me to ward the runes but the donkey is still crawling they call me noob for not buying wards but a gold per second is all i get and i dont even have my boots yet. Pros Learned Russian Learned of entire world are Russians Learned how to communicate with emoticons Learned how to get trolled Learned how to avoid RANKED button Learned world is not fair Learned C Y K A btw. Cons C Y K A. Honestly, I really dont know what to say. Ive been playing dota for a year and it has taught me a lot. Being able to play with your friends is something one cant fanthom. Meeting new people is like a dream come true. Its like a step out from your comfort zone. I love dota and its adventures. Collecting cute items like couriers and cute cm sets. It really gives you a sense of value. What I dislike about dota is its updates. That would be all. Things I gave to DotA Money Time Love Things DotA gave me Arthritis Carpal tunnel syndrome Hatred of Russians, Mexicans, Spanish, Finnish, and Russians Broken keyboard Broken mouse ready Server crashes stacks of Russians in EUW servers on English prefrence settings Ranked matches Free to play but Pay to win games I.E. Foreseers contract, New Bloom Its in the bag spam especially Skywrath Multilingual cursing I guess this is a good thing? Split second math ReliableUnreliable gold and gold loss on death vs. Buyback availability This is good too Essentially DotA is a greedy woman, but I love her all the same. would play again Update Since posting this review back in Feb a lot has changed in the game. Some of this is irrelevant to the game today. Also, dont take what is wirtten here personally. Update To all whom think that I copied this off someone elses review, look at the date at which my review was posted and then look at the others. I find it funny that people like my review so much they plagiarize it. Just so you know, I wrote it while on the toliet. Bad community but great game. I feel myself becoming more Russian every time i play this game. Are you having a great day? Dota can fix that! Do you enjoy playing games with your friends? Dota can fix that too!. Hats. Russians. Peruvians. Racism. Screaming. Teamwork. Friends. Lost friends. Strategy. FP. Contests. Victory. Loss. Addictive. Yeah, I think Ill reccomend this game. I wish from the very deep of my heart for every single feedertoxic playermatch ruiner to get CANCER FOR REAL AND DIE AND ROT SLOWLIE WITH A PAINFUL AGONY!!!. Every team consists of people .You .Russian Guy .Another Russian Guy .Russian Guy who speaks English A year old kid who slept with your mother Too much Salt and ,not enough Kurvva Would love to take another dose of salt and punch my little brother same review for CSGO and DOTA because they have that in common. So much fun that youll lose your mind and before you know it youve spent hours on it and youre left an empty shell of the person you were. This game is not for the faint hearted. You will be abused, beaten, broken, griefed, tormented and hated on the entire time, and yet you cant stop playing because of the high you get when you win an minute comeback game against mega creeps and divine rapiers. This must be how drug addicts feel. But is it worth it? Dota takes sane men and turns them into vile despicable human beings and you have to play with and against such people on a regular basis. To win you must now become captain of the SS dumbfk and somehow try to convince your teammates fighting the enemy team and not their own is in their best interest.Its also got he highest concentration of DunningKruger patients in the entire online gamming community. Valves terrible low priority system doesnt help. Assuming youre a masochist and you arent deterred by all of the above, you get to experience probably the best free online multiplayer game on the planet. With dota you get.. heroes, items,hundreds of hero strategies, tens of thousands of lane matchups and infinite replayability. You can and will spend years just learning about each of them. Dota has a thriving pro scene with the international giving out the biggest prize pools in all of esports and many regular sports. New patches and compendiums keep the gameplay fresh for most of the year. The latest international had a pick rate of heroes which is a testament to how well the game is balanced. And if youre a gambling man, dota is just the game for you. Introducing more lootboxes than any other game youve ever seen! Want literally any cosmetic in the game? Well there is a lootbox with your name on it waiting to be opened gabeN. Just remember no matter how good you get at dota, youre never good enough.and youll end up chasing the mirage of a high mmr and good players while trodding though mud and ht and you never realize its not real till youre in too deep. Graphics You forget what reality is Beautiful Good Decent Bad Dont look too long at it Paint.exe Gameplay Addictive like heroin Very good Good Its just gameplay Mehh Starring at walls is better Just dont Audio Eargasm Very good Good Not too bad Bad Earrape Audience Kids Teens Adults Average Solitare Players PC Requirements Check if you can run paint Potato Decent Fast Rich boiiiiii Ask NASA if they have a spare computer Difficulity Just press A Easy Significant brain usage Easy to learn Hard to master Difficult Dark Souls Grind Nothing to grind Only if u care about leaderboardsranks Isnt necessary to progress Average grind level Too much grind Youll need a second life for grinding Story Story?

BEST GAME FOR MY ANGER MANAGEMENT Wow is this game relaxing! It is a team game, v. Every teammate Ive ever had has been great, nice, and friendly! Everyone chooses the correct classes based on previous selections. Everyone know English. Everyone has a microphone and helps out! I would reccomend this game to anyone and everyone that has massive anger issues because WOW is this game fun and NEVER gets me angery EVER. EVERYONE is GREAT. I ING LOVE THIS GAME. I ING THIS GAME, ING CALL YOUR MISSINGS YOU MORON PEICE OF TRASH WOW DID YOU JUST ULT THAT CREEP WHY ARE YOU GOING MIDDLE AS AXE. After nearly games, which means unique teammates and unique opponents, I can personally certify and guarantee that at least of these people are not worthy of the air they breathe or the water they drink. This game is a testament to how the vast majority human beings possess selfishness beyond limits and stupidity beyond measure. The community of this game is evidence that we truly live with a coddled generation of children who were raised to believe that they are special and unique and superior to all other people and can literally do no wrong. The vast majority of people who play this game would benefit greatly from having the beaten out of them. Blame simulator I speak Fillipino fluently after weeks of playing it. Human misery in video game format. One of the worst games ever. I respect it a lot. I hate this game. I play it every day. Best MOBA out there!. best game ever Heroes are Free I dont care about Dota Never did, but I always loved to play as the Paladin in Warcraft Reign of Chaos and The Frozen Throne in battle.net solo ladder matches. If you played ladder in that game, you know that nobody selects the Paladin as their main or even secondary hero. I obviously lost a lot, but I had fun. Then the custom maps corridors, footmen rush, dota, etc came out where I could play as a single hero. I enjoyed those maps a lot since I could victoriously play as the Paladin. So when Dota came out and it had the Paladin in it, I was all in! In all my hours played in Dota I only played as Omniknight. I already stopped playing this game since it was time to move on, but I couldnt just leave my Paladin without saying goodbye so I created my Omniknight guide where I just opened my soul and let the juices flow. That Dota Steam guide is now on page out of pages of Top Rated All Time. play hours still suck at this game once u uninstal this game, more easier to install it again even if u try hard to not play this game, u still watch dota wtf on youtube.. Ultimate Russian Simulator Dota Russian Language Simulator DOTA is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, that adopted most of its mechanics from the original DOTA Mod of Warcraft Now, lets come to some of its features Once you understand the basics, and become good at the game oh wait, everyone of us is a noob you will soon have a huge backlog of other games. P Basically hat simulator. Can cause rage, anxiety and affect your mental state. too many griefers You make good moves in a game, and you wont be recognized. Go feed once and get reported. You will start putting aside other priorities. Ty Dota. To sum it up, it has a community like most other MOBAs, unless you are insanely good at the game. Recommended! Best game ever played!. You cost your team the game. Not the guy who went AFK for minutes to chase a goat. Not the person who charged the enemy zerg group alone. Not the idiot who attacked Roshan by themselves. You. It is always your fault. Play this with a set group of people you know and trust. Otherwise you shall be thrown into a community where everyone hates eachother, they all think you are the worst player ever even if you are the best on the team, and are never ever responsible for their own screwups. Seriously. the sheer volume of rage I have seen players show in this game is unlike anything Ive seen anywhere else. I stay away from this game now not because it is bad, but because ragey people ruin my fun. If you can get past this. its actually a pretty decent game. You have been warned. oo. I originally played Dota when it was merely a UMS on WC, so take this review for what its worth. Dota is an addictive experience however, this game also draws a player base from the bottom of society. If that statement is an insufficient description of the game, continue reading. This game is not for the casual gamer, this game is for those who have the capability to log in hundreds of hours into a game. If you play this game, I can attest that there will be times you love it and times you just want to break your monitor with your keyboard. I have a few hundred hours into the game and no matter how long you play, no matter what you do, you will encounter someone who will complain about something youre doing poorly or not doing correctly and it may ruin the gameplay for you. I can only recommend this game if you have thick skin or you have friends to play with. So here are what I consider the pros and cons of the game Pros This is a very intricate strategy based game that relies heavily on teamwork and timing. Free to play with optional cosmetic costs. Gameplay always varies due to each individual hero selection. This, in effect, increases replayability tremendously. Wonderful voice actors with interesting dialogue choices by the developer. Winning matches in this game often triggers the release of dopamine in the reward center in your brain creating the desire to play more. This in effect causes players to really want to win and may be the trigger of many cons of the game. Cons This game has a steep learning curve, believe me, there is way more to this game than you might think at first glance. Unlike hero customization in League of legends, not all heroes are created equal and not all ward placements are either. It can be a little intimidating to think that your team is already at a disadvantage from the hero selection, but thus is DOTA. Secondary to the steep learning curve, games tend to be won or lost by the actions of an individual on either team. This can be ameliorated by steam implementing some sort of fundamentals of gameplay video instead of the current lackadaisical tutorial they have. Suffice to say, many new players do not understand that every time their hero is killed by the opposing team, the player loses gold and the other team gains gold. This doubles the impact that each individual has for gameplay. Unlike other video game developers, Steam does not region lock. This brings about an unforeseen consequence where individuals from any country can join any server despite having a language preference. You can imagine how difficult it is to create a coordinated cohesive team push when theres a Russian only speaker, Spanish only speaker and a Portuguese only speaker on the US WEST server. Blame is a word that is thrown around in this game like the word inequality is thrown around in America. Unfortunately, this is by far the worst aspect of the game. The game community has very little to no interaction prior to gameplay or thereafter and there is no review conversation on what an individual can do to improve in the future. More often than not, an individual will oversimplify the ongoing team loss to action by individual because of time constraints and heated emotions. There is no team forfeit vote option in game and often you are sitting there for minutes as the other team wastes your time despite securing a victory much earlier. This review is from personal experience and your gameplay may vary. Of course, if you do meet someone ingame who is a decent person, be sure to commend them at the end of the match for their ingame courtesy. Final Rating Game Game community One of the most addicting games Ive ever played, paired along with one of the worst online communities Ive ever seen. Not even joking. The only time I didnt have a Russian player in the lobby was when I was playing on the Russian servers. This game is really great.

Game is okay but I still havent done all the quests! EDIT Hahaha I never read the comments on this D really hilarious! Mostly that I dont have a life and stuff, Im happy to be informed of this! People that worry that I dont see the sun, Im swedish, theres no sun to begin with so dont worry. People thinking I wasted hours of my life, well this is my fulltime job for the last years, streaming dota. I had great fun and made a sustainable income, just like anyone else who loves their job. Whenever you search for a Dota game a plane flys over Russia and picks random civilians. a fun game with friends D. Welcome to a game a false promises, now leave, before you get addicted. This game will ruin your personality, cause you to drift into a limbo state between insanity and reality, and make you lose all hope in the nature of the human race. No matter how good you will ever be, you are always trash. Think otherwise? Something that a trash player would say. The learning curve is infinite, nobody has ever completely mastered the game. Your individual skill is ranked and measured in a system that only counts your winloss in a game where players must work together to win. Dont bother narrowing your search results, all the Rusperus are pretty much the same. Welcome to Dota, youre trash, now unistall you ing After over hours of gameplay, I can safely sum Dota up in two words THE TRENCH aka Forced Fifty You will win. You will lose. You will improve your skill, but you will never improve your score. wait for it No. Matter. What. Why? Because of THE TRENCH ForcedFifty. The better you get at this game, the worse your teammates will be. This is not a paradigm, it is mechanically programmed into the game. If you can carry idiot on your team, the game will handicap you with Skilled enough to carry After a few games you will get Hardcore enough for Now you get FOURever. Your teammates will i you not go out of their way to lose on purpose. You picked another carry because it seemed logical? Well guess what, I got a few replays that will show crybabies throwing the game so you cant compete for thier spotlight. This is the only game where teammates ENJOY LOSING because it means they can bring you down to their garbage level. People literally buy and sell accounts off MMR because of teammates and you will be a guinea pig in their money making ponzi schemes. Have fun wasting hours of your time on k MMR the alleged decent tier while you witness first hand feeders lose you the game minute by minute. I could have been a doctor with those hours. The dawn of a new era. Rat Doto Best Doto. If u want cancer, go play it. Dota ranks among few titles that can be classified as truly freetoplay. While many other titles label themselves with this distinction, there are often convenience purchases or some form of power available for real money transactions. While Dota has an extensive cash shop, all offerings are completely cosmetic. HUD options, voice packs and character costumes form the basis of a store lacking even an iota of power or convenience for purchase. All gameplay elements are absolutely free and do not require collection or usage of any kind of ingame currency. Once a player has determined that theyre ready to commit to a steep learning curve and potential negative interactions with teammates Again, learn with friends to reduce this aspect, Dota is incredibly enjoyable and possibly one of the best multiplayer games ever made. Every match is different, and watching perfect team fight execution is gaming art. Players have access to a huge range of hero styles and the interactions between teammates and foes are incredibly diverse. Its twenty to fortyfive minutes of gladiatorial bliss, the end result carefully orchestrated from the first enemy tap to the final crushing blow. Dota can be experienced and enjoyed at multiple levels of engagement, and its a title that rewards users for a deep dive. Heavy investment, heavy reward. The barrier to entry isnt quite as bad as it was years ago, but it would be disingenuous to say that the game doesnt have a colossal learning curve. As a freetoplay title readily available on Steam, it offers players a frictionless doorway but the challenge may be keeping new players interested and willing to commit to the epic journey that is learning, playing, and enjoying Dota The game is in a strong place right now. Its rewarding and sociable like few other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. The next few months will be crucial its currently the best expression of Valves progressive attitude towards players, and if it can continue on that track it describes a future for online gaming that is far more hopeful than the one were used to. Just remember to spend your starting cash, and make sure someone buys the courier. Oh, and when Riki starts showing up in your games, just get some Sentry Wards down and dont run away. Also, you always want a Bottle when in midlane, and runes spawn at and again every two minutes. Practice lasthitting before you go online. And if youre jungling, memorise where the lowlevel Creeps are. Actually, you know what? Forget all that.

I played on EU West, and set my language option to English. I now speak different languages. cancer years later, over hours spent edit still cancer. They told me to get a life, so I took theirs. Im sorry, Master, it wont happen again. Its like hardcore drug use and it destroys lives. Give it a go, whats the worst that could happen? Well, you could be here game hours later hating yourself as you queue for another all pick. Send help. As in TP bottom because theyre five manning. I guess I have to review this game because Ive banked so many hours into it. Ill keep it brief. Dota is probably the most frustrating game ever created. Your team will let you down constantly, the enemy team will consistently pick the heroes you hate playing against the most, you will never get the hat drops you want, and your own mind and body will frequently betray you and make you contend with the fact that you are not nearly as good as you think you are or, more likely, force you to live in a fantasy dream world where you are as good as you think you are and just blame your teammates some more. Itll turn you into a monster and destroy your life. Itll murder your loved ones and feed them to you. But youll play it anyway. Youll ragequit and uninstall and stare at your library of games as the creeping realization sweeps over you that you not playing Dota will not effect the universe in even the smallest way, will have no conceivable effect on anything. You will be filled with a sudden dread that nothing you do matters and life has no meaning. Basically the same feeling you get when you play Dota And Dota will be your only distraction from this dessicated husk of a life. So the next day youll find yourself drawn back into it like a moth to a flame, staving off the moment when youll have to face your demons for as long as you can. You will probably die alone some day and nobody will remember how high your MMR was or your sunstrike accuracy. So what are you waiting for, you worthless peons?! Get out there and dance! DANCE FOR THE PUPPETMASTER GABE! GO EARN YOUR HATS, YOU CRAVEN MONGRELS! would not recommend to anyone but cant stop playing and wont be able to stop you either. New interface is WAY too small, did they test it on monitors or something? New GUI ruined the game, lost probably more than half the player base, no more synergy in GUI and atmosphere is gone from dota! Dont know why they changed it like this maybe they dont want to make any money anymore? Does Valve want to quit supporting Dota in favor of new MOBA maybe? Skip this game for now it has became tainted BAD. edit november it became even worse After the most recent major update, they changed the game to LoL ., this is not Dota anymore. End of an era for one of the best moba games. To bad some LoL players have taken over Valve and started to simplify the whole game. This Game taught me so much. How to Curse in Russian.

If you like to watch the hours of your youth drip away like sand through an hour glass, then this is the game for you. If you like watching snotty know it alls get crushed in all too ironic ways by the enemy, then this is the game for you. If you like the sweet sting of success being ruthlessly snatched away from you as the enemy ploughs through your advance on their base like a warm knife through butter, then this game is for you. If you like low level intensity games, where even if you lose, your pride stays intact, or games that dont have you swearing like a Tarantino film at the screen over the smallest thing.then this game is not for you. Dota is like cyber cocaine. How to fix Right click on Dota Delete Local Game Content Delete. Fixed! SeriouslyUpdated! Does Valve hate us?

But the next day you will still play it with a new keyboard and mouse like nothing happened. I dont know if i should recommend this game or not .hmm i think i should. League of Legends has the spanish, this has the russians. These two games have brought out a racist side in me that I never thought existed. While having hours played in LoL, and developing a strong hatred for the spanish and any other culture that speaks something close to spanish, this game has also made me develop a hatred for the russian community. As you can see, Ive only played odd hours of this game at the time this review was made, but if I had to add at least ONE positive note to this review, its this. Ive mananged to learn russian in only a few hours, grasping the most important phrase, This phrase runs through my mind, every day of every minute. I sometimes even say it to myself in my head IRL when I see someone doing something moronic. This game is a russian weapon developed by Putin himself to enslave the world, along with the help of whatever leader Brazil has right now. While most of the friends I play with play LoL, I quit that in order to seek refuge from the spanish epidemic there is over there, but instead, have been sucked into this South AmericaRussian racism simulator wasting most of the extra money I have on steam to buy cosmetic items for heroes Ive just played. I never liked history when in school, I hated it, with a passion, just like the Americans with their hatred for the Russians. This game has taught me everything I need to know on why to hate russia, how to hate russia and question the very existance of that country based on the ape like intelligence that Ive seen coming from the country. In short, if youve always been a saint in your life, never swore, never hated another culture, never thought of abusing everyone you know that doesnt speak english that well, then Id suggest not playing MOBAs entirely, all jokes aside. If cancer had to be a game, this would be it. Without a thought. What valve has done, is develop a way of making World War possible. Along with the help of Putin, and his various ape test subjects that Ive encountered in the game. would keep playing. As this was my first MOBA game, my first few hours were spent hearing people calling me bad, insulting my mom, and questioning my sexuality. Now after hours, I can safely tell others they are bad, tell them to uninstall, and call them ugly. game is satisfying after learning. Its a fun game, but it will tear your soul out if you arent careful. Also a free but rather rage inducing Roseta Stone. Learn up to languages today!.

U can play any game from steam but in the end u will return to dota. As this was my first MOBA game, my first few hours were spent hearing people calling me bad, insulting my mom, and questioning my sexuality. Now after hours, I can safely tell others they are bad, tell them to uninstall, and call them ugly. game is satisfying after learning. Im only talking from my experience in pubs. It feels gratifying when you win. It feels frustrating when you lose. In DotA you will lose alot whether you want it or not. What matters in this game isnt your hero or this pointless counter picking. Your performance is solely dependant on skill, experience and reaction time. However, no matter how good you are, defeat is inevitable with a bad team. At the beginning when youre matched with new players such as yourself, this can be quite infuriating and almost made me stop playing after approximately hours. Thats why I strongly advise you to play with friends, so you actually have a coordinated team. About the game itself Its a solid with a big diversity of unique heroes. The majority of the community is quite unpleasant at times and isnt very beginnerfriendly which can be really offputting. If you ignore these people a.k.a. muting and just keep doing your thing, you will find yourself genuinely having fun after hours. hours sounds kinda extreme but it really isnt. This is the kind of game you can spend thousands of hours on and you still wont be able to fully master it. If youre ready to go through all this hardship and frustration, go for it, I highly recommend DotA If youre looking for a casual multiplayer game that you can get into quickly, stay away from this. Im going to start off with Im a fan of Dota, it is an interesting and fun game requiring team synergy and tactical awareness. Its design is wonderfully built, its ui is easy to use, and its all around entertaining. Its intuitive and original, and stands out in contrast with many other MOBAs. Its provided me with hours of fun. Ive even invited several people to the game. Now then, everything said above is no longer true, the outofgame ui is still fantastic, but soon as you get ingame you have to ask yourself, Where the is anything? you either need a magnifying glass or superior farsighted vision. The characters are overbalanced so unless you build a perfect team together, better luck next game. It looks like the Dev team hit copy and paste with League of Legends, the usefullness of map awareness is negated. Here, while were putting our feet in our mouths lets do the most unoriginal character EVER, Wukong! Thats right, Dota is home to the most overused character on the planet, hes better than ever with a nearly perfect identity with every other MOBA on the web. Lets assume our players are willing to get headaches to play, so back to the ui, the WHAT? Its invisible, its transparent, its the new big THING! Its the most beautiful NOTHING youll never lay eyes on! Oh, and you wanted to scale it? Haha, Valve thinks youre funny. Honestly, if youre going to update a game, PLAYTEST it, how is that difficult? Oh, there IS a test server you say? Who cares! Lets release all this unstable crap on our unsuspecting players. report is given in a month period. Thats right, if you want to report someone SAVE it for that VERY special someone, cuz you only get one chance! Commends the same way? Well, my commends havent refreshed since october, want to know why? Cuz I play support, and my overall average scores are lower as a result. You hold on to that hope that theyll fix things, and they usually do. briefly. Ive spent money on the game, know what that means? Nothing, cuz unless you unload your whole bank your words arent even heard. Sometimes I wonder if everyone at Valve who interacts with Dota keep cats around so they can sleep on the keyboard when they decide to start trilling away ideas. When one thing breaks, break everything else to fix it. Hm, I hear the Dota community is great. lets go try. No no, great in this case means the rudest and cruelest gamers. If you dont have a whole group of friends to play with you get stuck with trolls or people who use their faces for they keyboards. This isnt true if you play on foreign servers, but even still it is a gambit. Great white This is Dota not League of Legends Update score, UI Lore Monkey King? Really? Stability Entertainment Contrast. UI Lore Stability Entertainment Id love to love the game again. Dota is an ARTSMOBA. Although its a video game, it taught me a lot about what to do in the real world! Communication Before Dota Hey dude how you doing?

Every now and then Ill give back some playful jabs but Im not very imaginative. My favourite lines are ill wear your skin kunt and your whorsish mother will taste your blood tonight stain Classic banter. Dota is one of if not the most frustrating and aggravating game ever created. Your teammates will cater the enemy team, not back you up, and refuse to call missings or place wards. The enemy team will always pick combos or heroes that will make you want to immediately leave the game while your teammates pick carrys after you randomed Phantom Assassin and tell you to buy the wards. Every other game you will get a Russian Pudge picker that feeds kills mid in minutes and immediately ruins all the work youve done last hitting every creep and harassing the enemy out of lane. Youll rage and call GG early and trash talk your teammates but youll still keep playing in hope that the game will turn around. As things start to finally look good, you get bashed times in a row by a faceless void or the Ogre Magi will get a x multicast on you times in a row while the Natures prophet is pushing your top barracks. But after all the rage inducing pain, you keep playing. You suffer through it for the chance of that amazing, satisfying comeback even though youre gold behind the enemy team. Only to have your dreams crushed when the enemy team finally kills your ancient. But you still keep playing due to the feeling you get when you get that rampage that allows you to push to victory. Even so, after the game youll still rage because of the common chest you get as a reward for your minutes of pain and suffering. When you finally get that mythical youve always wanted, valve will come out with an event that lowers the price and makes it almost worthless. Its a drug that once hooked to, is almost impossible to break. You almost dont even realize youre raging and forget that youre telling your best friend how much of a feeding he is and how this lost game is because of him when youre the one who has kill and deaths. You keep playing in hope that youll get good enough where youll be able to play with Dendi or the other pros and you know thatll most likely never happen but you keep playing in hope of it happening one day. I would not wish this addiction on my worst enemy. But I cant stop you, nor can I stop playing myself. Do you hate life? Existence? Everyone around you? Do you just want to make everyone else suffer just because youre in a rough spot that clearly isnt your own fault despite mistakes being made? Or are you just looking for a good language teaching program for Portuguese, Spanish and Russian? Then look no further, DOTA has you covered. Free russian dictionary!. This game ruined my life. I have failed my academic career. I have no ing social life anymore, or any self esteem. All i do is play this game and get depressed. Just a note Yes this a joke, Jeez. ruined my life dont play this game, it makes doing meth look healthy. The easiest way to kill time .For a couple of years and for thousands of hours Do not play it. Most ed up game ever, took me almost k hours to find out how ed up the community, matchmaking and everything around that game is. Sad, and Im the only one to blame for flushing my time down the drain. On the contrary, PRO community is one of the best communities out there, always fun to watch and follow, from players to casters, everyone is cool. I just cant play this anymore, its a pain, mental and physical pain. Dota is the semisequelremakerereleaseevolution of the longrunning WarCraft mod Defense of the Ancients, which in itself was based on a custom map for StarCraft called Aeons of Strife. After the release of the original Dota map in the WarCraft community began producing a long line of Dota spinoffs, sequels and mods just as Eul, Dotas creator, had used AoS as inspiration for Dota itself, which culminated in the release of DotA Allstars by Steve Guinsoo Feak. Allstars would become the most dominant and consistently updated version of all the Dota maps and mods. In Guinsoo passed the torch to the enigmatic IceFrog, who has been supporting, updating, and shaping Dota ever since. His changes have been the most significant, the most popular the mod grew more during his time than ever before, and arguably have benefited and enriched Dota as a whole. By DotA Allstars became simply DotA, and IceFrog was showing no signs of stopping. Later that year, Dota was formally announced with its development spearheaded by both IceFrog and Eul, both of its most important authors its past and present, alike, entered a semiclosed beta in late and was finally officially released in mid. and the rest is history. History lessons aside, Dota is a game of uncompromising depth and complexity. Though its gameplay intricacies can appear opaque, arbitrary and incomprehensible at first sight, the way these expansive game mechanics interact with one another when exposed to the element of player imperfection is truly remarkable over a hundred heroes, each with at least four spellbased abilities and all capable of using up to six magical items, from a massive arsenal of over a hundred. Games can last anywhere from to minutes, and possibly far more! Dotas metagame is constantly shifting, and as of writing the game and mod are at total parity through version ., released earlier this year. On top of that, it is completely free to play, with no features locked out to any players whatsoever. Not even cosmetic items, which form the backbone of the games vast microtransactionbased economy these items are freely distributed by Valve to all players through levelbased gift drops and randomchance item drops. Free game updates alter the game balance significantly, while introducing new seasonal game modes, and far more. And thats not even scratching the surface of the games competitive scene, with its many tournaments, its constantly evolving teams and its own storylines, all leading up to the annual Valveorganized grand championship The International. It may be incredibly difficult and frustrating at first, but given time, patience, simple memory and a keen mind, anyone can ultimately come to see Dota as perhaps the most enjoyable, enthralling and captivating game experience ever conceived. Oh, and its. I have played Dota for a little over three years now, so I think I am finally ready to give it an in depth review. I gave this game a review back in but I am going to change that. First of all, Im going to start by listing off what I like about the game. THE PROS Dota is, obviously, a team game. Playing this game with friends is a really fun experience and can act as a source of really fantastic memories. My point is, if you play this game with a group of four other friends, Dota is probably one of the best options out there. Dota has a fantastic tutorial system and the game is very well designed to accomodate new players. A new player can go from a full AI game to an AI game with other random people to playing a v online the transition is really smooth. I have played both League and Dota, and I can honestly say that I think that Dota is much more visually pleasing to look at. A smooth, clean UI makes the game easier on the eyes compared to Leagues cartoony design which suits some, but not me. Dota has an extremely vast pool of heroes that can be played to suit almost anyones playstyle. After you play Dota for awhile, you can pick out the heroes that really fit your playstyle and excel at them through ranked matchmaking. Its damn near impossible to be bad at literally every hero. The large hero pool allows for THOUSANDS of different lineup possibilities, meaning every game has the chance to be completely new and different than anything youve played before. Honestly, Dota is one of the most addicting games I have ever played. No it is THE most addicting game I have ever played. As a fulltime student, I still have managed to rack up hours in this game in my freetime. Especially back when I was a new player, I played this game all the time. However. I am actually changing my review of this game from positive to negative. Let me tell you why. THE CONS Heres my biggest flaw with the game. I absolutely hate I MEAN HATE Valves regional matchmaking. Before finding a match, the player is supposed to change server preferences to the closest servers to the members of the party, and they are supposed to choose the appropriate language preference. For example, as an American player, it is expected that you choose U.S. West and U.S. East as your servers, with English as your language preference. And, generally, Americans follow this rule. HOWEVER. In almost every game I play now, I get a Peruvian or Brazilian or someone from South East Asia in my games. Hopefully it makes sense to the readers of this review that you should not be finding a match in the United States if you live in Asia. You lag, and become actually useless in the game. The South Americans, though, spam in their native languages and constantly flame. Am I generalizing? Honestly, no. Im really not. If you are good at Dota you would and should queue for games for which you are prepared to play at your best. Valve has no form of region lock on matchmaking they really cant, due to international professional teams, and while its really not Valves fault, I just wish there was some way to reliably play with four people from your country andor language. This is seriously Dota s biggest flaw, because so much of every game revolves around the synergy and cooperation among teammates. This is literally impossible when someone spends the entire game flaming you in a different language. Im honestly not trying to be discriminatory in any way this is just how Dota is in reality and is likely never to change. I have become so fed up with this poor form of matchmaking that I have actually, finally, uninstalled the game. Dota has actually no reliable way to punish feeders. Sure, you and your team can use the report system you only have a limited number of reports by the way, so after you expend them on flamers or feeders you are out of luck and have to enlist the other team and your teammates to waste their reports on the other feeders and flamers. The feeder may get put in low priority, but it honestly teaches them nothing. We have all been in low prio at one point or another, and we come out unchanged. Valve needs to implement a way to correct this. Im not alone in my view on this either. Even professional player Secret.Puppey voiced his opinion the other day, which is very similar to mine. Punishments need to become more severe. The Dota community is actually cancerous. If you are not playing in a stack of friends, I can almost promise you that you will very rarely, if ever, get on a team where all teammates are willing to cooperate and play as a coordinated team. Almost every single game, someone on your team will flame someone else for sucking really bad, mostly because they probably did. But people speak so hatefully towards one another that it really feels like an unwelcoming scene. One of the professional Dota casters joinDotas Capitalist tweeted the other day that he loses so much respect for pro players in pubs because they spend so much time flaming and tilting. This is actually about of the Dota community, actually, not just the professionals. Everyone has this weird god complex where they are convinced they are better than everyone on the server, even if they got no kills and fed unimaginably badly. This kind of ties in with the points I have made previously. It is almost impossible to singlehandedly win a game if your team is playing very poorly. Thus, the entire game comes down to teamwork and most Dota players are unreliable teammates who will either feed or flame roughly, like I said. The of people who dont flame are the people who are actually in professional teams and while they flame in pubs, they synergize well in their professional settings unless you are kuro and rtz. Dota is really bad for your health unless you have a godly amount of self control. If you win a game, you can end happy. But if you lose a game, you keep playing and keep losing and it becomes very depressing and frustrating. The garbage community gets in your head, and its just bad. Look, honestly, I fully expect to continue to follow the professional Dota scene. Dota really is one of the best games out there and its especially fun to watch the pros play. But, if you are looking for a MOBA that you can regularly enjoy, then you are better off playing StarCraft II, which is where I am headed now. Dont get me wrong, though Dota is still much better than League of Legends and I would never suggest League of Legends to anyone unless they are really, really struggling with Dota I wont be returning to Dota until Valve makes some much needed changes to the game, or at least until I have had a long, muchneeded break from the seriously draining community that Dota offers. TLDR Its a good MOBA, better than LoL, but too many community matchmaking issues to make this worth a positive. Gave me a great years of entertainment though. Play SCII. Rating Good game, for awhile. But community is horrible. The objective of this game is to spend all your paycheck on virtual clothing for your favorite characters so you can play dressup with them while looking better than the enemy team. Playing the game itself is completely optional. I hate this game so much. It hurts so much. I cry every time I see a I am pretty sure after almost hours of Dota I have developed a deep understanding of the Russian language. I even grew wings and taped almost popsicle sticks together and superglued a flashlight to the end of it and starting yelling gibberish with a thick accent. hours in dota and already know what means.. Opened Game. Found Match. Picked Sniper. Was told to uninstall. Uninstalled. Would not pick Sniper again. Just dont. Stay healthy. i waste my life and money on one map please help me. Product received for free Dota has Destroyed my Life. Dota is the official sequel to the highly popular mod for Blizzards Warcraft III, Defense of the Ancients. A mod that has been worked on by many, and therefore it was hard to determind where the rights belong. A lot of legal hocus pocus were going on between Blizzard and Valve last year, and it ended to valves favor. The Dota name and franchise is now legally a part of Valve, probably thanks to the sneaky acquisition of IceFrog the year before. Dota is a realtime strategy game in the subgenre called MOBA multiplayer online battle arena. A genre that has grown rapidly the past few years, with different type of alterations in favor of success. Dota is a close second to being the most popular MOBA, right behind the giant League of Legends. Just like LoL, Dota is gaining success throughout its competetive esport scene, and its clear that valve is highly pushing it towards the first position. The latest and biggest tournament was The International which included a total prize pool of over million US dollars, which was the biggest prize pool in esport history. Gameplay is easy to understand but very hard to master. The map consists of lanes that are constantly being pushed by NPC creeps. You are controlling a hero amongst other in your team, and are fighting against in the opposing team. The goal is to push your heroes and NPC creeps to the enemy base, where you have to destroy the ancient. It sounds pretty easy, but it requires hours upon hours to get a hold of the base mechanics, the more advanced mechanics and the professional mechanics. Plus the over heroes you get to play and face. After hours I have only touched what I call the more advanced mechanics, and I am not even close to professional level. The most experienced players have around hours of playtime and have spend the majority of their past years to Dota Since the game is Extremely competetive there will be a lot of curse words flying around while you play. These type of games are known for very hostile encounters with other players. There is an optional tutorial that you can take before going out there, beware though the tutorial does not cover any Russian. Dota might be competetive, extremely enraging and the learning curve is steep as crap, but it is still the game that I have spend the most time playing on Steam mostly because my collegues and bosses were playing it. Somehow I keep returning to it, so I suppose I am enjoying it. You better have people to play with though, and you better not be good friends because this game will take your beloved friendship and wipe its with it until you hate each other. Translations. I learned how to swear in Russian, Spanish, Portugese. I learned a lot of Russian language because of this game, so if youre studying Russian language, quit your collegecourse and start playing dota because why not. Also the pro scene is good. Lots of drama and stuff. It took me awhile to realize how much time I have wasted. would recommend. doto is gaem aboot guis fiting som udder guis to kill big magic rok thingu acros a reevir.

Its excellent for busy, older, slow people, I changed Bejeweleds icon to this game and my mom still havent noticed it!. Ruined my life Ice Frog once again messing up the frail balance of the game by introducing the new Monkey King hero in .. Utterly unbalanced hero and a complete mess of a game this has become. So many things u can do VALVE, but .. why!?.. Game is hard. avoid this game if you can. Patch has created a massive shift in the gameplay of Dota it is now very similar to league of legends. The hardcore difficulty and strategies have all seen a difficulty curve decrease, if youve never played Dota because it was to hard or confusing, now is the perfect time for you to start playing. Very fun game! Highly recommended. Pros Very Fun Makes Friends Learn Foreign Languages Cons Makes you Racist Sucks up your Time Makes you angry Get High Blood Pressure Infinite Toilet you Throw Monies in Makes you a Hateful Person Possibility of Carpal Tunnel Highly Recommended. Dota stands for Defense of the Ancients, or as I like to call it, Dota. The two is not to refer to the game being a sequel, which it is, but rather to specify the number of ancients in a game. The objective is to turn it into Dota In Dota, you need to defend an ancient, which is either a tree or a rock depending on your religious affiliation. Since Im one and twothirds Bhuddist, I usually end up defending one of them at random, much like all the other players. Dota is a very unique game, in that includes both offense and defense. There are lots of characters, and all of them are mostly good at different things. In my opinion, the best part of Dota is playing it. This is because Dota is an extremely unique combining many difficult strategies, such as attacking the enemy teams Ancient or defending your own Ancient. The goal of Dota, much like other games, is to win. If you become proficient at this skill, you will win very often, leading to more victories. Scientists show that six out of every three Dota players that win matches tend to be on the winning team when the game is over. This is because winning substantially increases your chances of not losing. Dota takes a while to learn though, and that is because it is an extremely offensive, yet defensive, game with many complicated nuances, like being a farmer or trying to help your teammates do good. One interesting feature of Dota is that dying is really bad, in the sense that you lose money and time because respawns are really long, like when Halo would just beep at you instead of spawning you and youd get really angry, except this is an intentional feature intended to spice up the classic innovation of offfense vs. defense vs. offense. Why did I write a third position in that last sentence? Excellent question. There are neutral enemies in the game, and they usually dont do a whole lot except sit there and be neutral. If you dont respect their space, however, you may find that they beging to fight back, much like an offensive form of selfdefense. Early in a match of Dota, you find yourself buying useful items like tp scrolls, also called Town Portal Scrolls, or Town Portal Scrolls for short. Why did I mention Town Portal Scrolls multiple times? Good question! That is because there are multiple teams. Once youve bought items, you go kill enemy creeps, and they arent people so its ethically sound and completely morally fine to do. Once youve spilt some blood, or watched as they comically struggle to kill each other for your favor, you may realize that you have more money and have leveled up. That is because creeps are made of gold stitched together by experience and points, and that usually transfers to you after they die. Think of it like inheritance or maybe a n involuntary tribute system. Once youve levelled up and gotten rich, you can buy better items that make you stronger, and then get new abilities like skills, active abilities, passive abilities, or passiveaggressive abilities. These abilities let you hurt creeps and other palyers more effectively, which may or may not be socially acceptable in your region of birth. Please refer to local ethic codes and statutes to determine whether victory is a viable gameplay style for you in your chosen country of choice. Once youve become the best allaround person you can be, or at least made some incremental progress down that road that usually takes about an hour on average, resets between games, so you never get bored its time to go tear down the other teams towers those, like many buildings in the united states, canada, or certain US territories, will fight back and damage you and then eventually go and destroy their Ancient, which is what the A stands for in Dota. That makes your team the winner, and implies that you are better people in a metaphorical sense than your enemy team counterparts. Anlatmaya gerek yok heralde seviyenin olduu moba !. Did not catch em all. I am quite sure that sums up everything. Update goes too far we dont want dota to become LoL or Hon respect your loyal fan base and fix your patch. Cant say which is worse the update or Spanish speaking trolls taking over the servers.. time to move on and never look back. The community is more toxic than a nuclear waste. Its bassicly meth, ruined my life, lost all my friends, gpa took a nose dive, parents have no more faith in me, no longer have hopes and dreams, and its the only thing left I know how to do. But the high I get while playing has yet to be matched. out of would recommend to anyone. Do you like to be insulted about your mothers sexuality? Like to have your intelligence questioned Like the sound of pinging Do you like to wait ?!? Then maybe Dota is the game for you Enjoy all this and so much more would be a feeding noob again. is realy freakin piece of sheat !!! KDA is invisible and where are megakill announces?! New minimalizm HUD fued up HUD buyers and I have played the game over thousand of hours but new HUD is small and freakn hard to recognize sitrep of the game. Fuing deginers must resign now!!! U nothing but Grand Theft Salary!!! and ruined the game Leave Valve and uninstall Dota now!! And return my freakin awesome Dota back!!!. This game helps you realize the stuggles that were present during the Cold War, and reinforces your fear of Russians, or at least playing with them. Team up with South Americans to battle the Russians and receive more negative feedback from your teammates than your ex girlfriend gave you about your small Once you realize that the South Americans are also your enemies, you can play on their servers to escape them because everyone knows that they only play on the U.S. Servers to slowly damage our mental stability to aid them in their everlasting mission to feel like they dont live in a third world country. I have put so many hours into this. Somanyhours. It is one of those games where you spend so much time learning the mechanics items, heroes, terrain, team strategy, etc. You learn all these things and it makes you want to stay with it because youve put so much work to build yourself to a decent MMR and win rate. This game is like a drug. Did I enjoy it with my friends at times? Sure. But the enjoyment always fought against the weight of the overwhelming frustration. It has the most toxic community I have ever seen in my decade of serious gaming. It wasnt so bad at first, but over the past hundred or so games it has become notably worse. Far worse. Make one mistake and you will have threats from your teammates to report you. Dont have a bad game, or you will have someone urging your team and the other team to report. Its just constant bickering and trash talk on both sides. Is it like this every game? No, of course not. There are decent individuals who play this game who will present constructive criticism and encouragement in a mature fashion. They might contain their frustration during the game or voice it over the chat, and thats understandable. This game will do that. But the vast majority are, sadly, among the poison that kills this game for me. A lot of the time I even ended up with teammates who didnt speak my language despite my search under US east. I can handle one or two or three or four. But when I go three games in a row where everyone on my team and the enemy team doesnt speak my language then, well, there is some great team communication there. Thats really the only issue Ive had with the game itself. Not too bad. The satisfaction from winning a few games cant make up for the stress and grievances encountered to get there either. Honestly, this game isnt fun anymore because of the community. It is well done. Its a great game, but the community ruins the satisfying experience I once had for this game. It is a real shame. I have hours of game time. hours of effort getting myself to around a k MMR. hours poured into a game that requires dedication and satisfaction through numbers and stats. And I am still going to try my best to give this game up despite all the work put into it. It will be tough. If you havent played the game yet, I cant recommend it. Not when the community is worse than its ever been. And Im not basing this on just a couple dozen games. Im basing my community experience on hundreds of recent hours. It is a real shame how the players in the game can ruin it. Maybe when Overwatch comes out it will have a decent community being optimistic and I can pour my hours into that and finally ditch this game for good. Maybe Ill come back when my friends are on to form a team, but I will never again jump into solo ranking with the community as horrible as it is. I really hate to leave a negative review on this great game, but the community has sucked the joy out of it. Game was great. ruined it. Cant move character with WASD what the hell is this?. WTF, I want my life back!! Gaben pls help. hours and still dont know what is happening on my screen TLDR Dont even start! Toxic community, destroys your life. edit dont miss out on the comments of this review! The first time I played Dota was years ago when it was still on WC. I stopped playing for some years and got back to playing since last year. Two reasons why you should avoid this at all cost Toxic community the worse out there! It is almost a given that someone on your team or the enemy team will start some aggressive flaming for no good reason. Racist remarks are the norm. Whenever somone dies, someone else gets blamedflamed. Extremely toxic! After enough hours of gameplay, this type of exposure is bound to spillover on you and give you a very negative outlook of life. What I noticed in me and my friends is that this blamingflaming culture influences us that we tend to unknowingly flame others back in response. Definitely not the kind of person I want to be. Dont expose yourself to such negativity in life! While the gameplay is amazing, keep in mind that this game is highly addictive. I once told my friend that he can do so many other things in life if he doesnt play dota. His response was If i dont do other things in life, I can dota more. I feel like this is the best way to describe how addictive this game can be. He plays at higher level games k MMR. He has since stopped, and Im so proud of him. Before, he used to play all day for over hours until am in the morning. Neglected college and everything else. I fell into that same rabbit hole. I averaged hours a week of dota. Totally soul sucking and toxic. I started having to hide this addiction and not tell others because of the shame of spending so much time on a video game. Neglected college and life. I stopped going out, stopped socializing. Most of the interaction I encounter everyday is from the toxic community. You can imagine how much I degraded. Because this addiction took over my life, I feel that my mental state of mind is so poor now. Low confidence in doing everything else because of all the time wasted in dota. So, this is kinda like my confession here. A way to help me break out of this, and a reminder to not relapse into such a unhealthy and pathethic state of living. Do yourself a favour and focus on real life, which matters and lasts. Dont waste hundreds and thousands of hours on this game that will not add to anything in your life it will only bring you negativity. Live life to the fullest. Time is the one thing you can NEVER get back. Do not regret. Que simulator is a gr game. I was able to get a combo of over minutes the other day. Would totally recommend for all hardcore gamers. First time playing a moba, guys told me I had downsydnrome and autism. this game is op. Sometimes your own life becomes boring or some difficulties make your life unbearable. In these times, in order to move away from my life, i play some games especially this game. it takes my mins. fairly convenient time. When i start this game it feels like im diving into some other universe. I figure out that i control some other things out of my organs. Then i feel this game in last points of my veins. After end of the game, i feel happy and relax no matter win or lose. I think i am addicted to this game. Pros Free to play Cons Bad community Cause Depression Frustration Cancerous Increase usage of vulgarities Ruin your life Be prepared to get report anytime Increase rage count. This brand new game by Riot puts a spin on the definition of Casual Gaming. What consumers thought would be another fun and enjoyable experience for the family turned out to be much more. This game is called Dota which is an acronym for Delicious Orange Teamwork Association the sequel to the original DOTA. DOTA revolves around teams of players each the perfect number for a happy family and maybe even a friend to all sit down on the couch and play together as a team who are both trying to sell as many oranges as possible while sabotaging the enemy teams orange sales! Gameplay is very casual and easy to pick up. You dont even have to play the tutorial if you dont want to! Just jump in the game, let everyone know youre new and start selling oranges! Speaking of new players, those who are new to the DOTA universe might be a little discouraged by all the terms that more experienced players use, so Ill explain a few of them here. Feeding is when your team is selling oranges at a very fast rate. This is very good, so make sure you feed as much as possible! is a term you may see thrown around a lot by players of this game. DOTA is a very popular game in Russia, because it is developed by a mysterious individual named Ice Man who is from Russia! is a friendly term that roughly translates to Keep up the good work! Report When someone says Reported. or Im going report u! that means that they are filling out a sales report on how well youve sold oranges! This is a fun way to keep track of how good you are at the game, and its considered friendly to try to report the best players you see in a game, even if theyre on the enemy team! DOTA has over fifty dozen players on at a time, so you better get playing now and become a veteran because before you know it, everyone and their grandmas will be playing the new nationsweeping casual game DOTA !. It is not necessary, do not do it. I was never racist until I played dota. According to the U.S. Foreign Service Institute, it takes approximately hours to acquire advanced proficiency in Japanese language. It would take approximately hours of studying to finish university and receive a major. According to The National Jurist, it takes about to hours to prepare for the bar exam passing which makes you a lawyer. It requires near hours to read Leo Tolstoys War and Peace and Anna Karenina both. The Department of Health and Human Services of the USA recommends an average adult to do roughly hours of sports a year to stay healthy. You get the point. Dont even frakking think of playing this. This game simulates being locked in a room with Tourette Guys while playing with some dragons, wizzards and other strange creatures. I just played a few games rly nice but hard game. Slowly i am getting into it. Its like Chess, but its not. Best MOBA game ever. Although its not easy to learn at first, DOTA has various elements which a MOBA game should have. Totally outstanding and addictive. MOBADOTAMOBA. It used to be fun but with this new update and new unbalanced hero, this game is completely ed up. Thanks valve for ruining the game for us all. So glad i quit this game at .. now im not sad about this update. Valve Icefrog or whoever made some patches before, but last update. I want to say fock you to all who made this crap. Worst update ever. Interface now really makes me wish to be blind. New map is just a nonsence, and this new hero is just the product of sick developers imagination. I totally refuse to belive that someone REALLY want me to play dota after this upda. Downgradefrom Down syndrome. Why Valve desperatly wants to make dota more casual? They want new players? But what about me, for example? I really love dota! I played it when it was beta! Why bunch of future s is more important than nowdays community? I just dont get it. Looks like Valve really dont gives a single about players. Dota is great game but the community is literally the worst. if you dont play with friends and decide to always play with randoms you will experience the highs and the lowest lows of the game. Make a small mistake and you are flamed and reported into low priority queue. This game is not for people who want a good time, even in unranked nothing about this game is casual as the most elite players will queue with you just to trash you for being a bad teammate. Unless you want to spend the first couple hundred hours learning in bot matches like I did i do not reccomend getting this game, it is not for the faint of hard or the casual player. Game was perfect until .. biggest disappointment. this game changed my life, i dont know if its for the positive or negative yet. who thought reborn was a good idea. Got A on my Russian exam. dota what a ing joke. New friends, interesting events, amazing heroesvoice actors, beautiful items, will help you learn a foreign language, good practice for trading activity. lot of stress and negative emotions. Horrible matchmaking system, very often aggressive noob teammates, time killer. And as said a random lol player .we all want to win, but having fun should be the priority. I shall remember this. DOTA helps you realize the uselessness of the real world. I now know how futile it is to have a girlfriend, a college degree, a job etc. All you need is a bunch of tangoes, some branches and clarity, and the world is all yours. Dota is a very highly skilled game, dont expect to walk in and expect you being very good. You are going to die alot and probably yell at your team mates but thats just the nature of this game. Dota takes place in an arena where you will fight to destory the enemies Anicent if you destory it you win. The Ancient is protected by stuctures called towers that protect it. Each of these towers are found in each of the three lanes bottom, middle and top. You take control of a unit that is a hero, many of them are diverse and have a lot of pros and cons such as Crystal Maiden who is really good at locking down heros early game with her stun but she is also the slowest hero in the game. You are accompanied by other players including yourself to fight against another players. You need to push lanes to be able to destory the enemy towers in each lane but the catch is the enemy team is doing the same thing, so you need to not only push to your victory but to stop the enemy team from pushing aswell. There is heros in Dota out of the heroes that are in the Warcraft III. They are categorised into groups. Strenght, which are usually the tanky guys. Agility, most carries are found in this category and Intelligence which most of the supports are usually found. All these heroes have different skill levels, such as Invoker who is an intelligence hero with spells. He is able to create spells with of his spells, creating the other He is able to create tornados which disable enemies, meteors which looks epic and burns enemies that stand in front of it. Just an all round crazy hero. Viper is arguably the easiest hero which as passive spells Passive spells are spells that work all the time, you dont need to activate them and other spells which are targetable. You can customise your Dota experience with annoucer packs which change the voice of the annoucer which include Glados and the narrator from the Stanley Parable. You can change your HUD to different themes. The game allows you to buy tickets where you can support tournments, some of these tournments allowing you to directly contribute to the prize pool. Most of the time it is In The International is a annual tournment created by Valve for Dota In the prize pool for this tournment became .M dollars. First place got M dollars! If you are into ESports then this game will be up your ally. Dota is a hard game, but if you look in the right places you are able to learn a lot, if you arent sure you want to play this game, you can PM me and I can teach you how to play. I honestly dont mind. At this point in time, Ive wasted round years of my life playing this game. Its a small amount compared to the hours that my peers and teammates have amassed, even I, who had started when beta was released to the general public. A good chunk of the gaming population has played it at least once, or have heard of it, or am still playing even as type this review out. Anywho, lets talk about Dota. Dota is not a game its a major time sink. You spend the first games improving your gameplay to be even called below average, whilst losing horribly in every single one. You will weep. Burst in an outrage. Asking yourself why did you ever choose to play this game in the first place. Every single game roughly consists of mins that you give all your efforts to be returned with a fleeting feeling of joy. Bliss. Or the soul crushing depression of losing the past games during the weekend the times you turned down your friends at a night out to play this game. Its not because Dota is hard. No, no. Its not the mechanics that you have finetuned yourself in being able to do over and over a times without messing up. In my words, it could very well be as easy as playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure or as ball crushing hard as playing Dark Souls with no proper equipment simply because the game boils down to one thing Teamwork. Synergy between people, how they cooperate, willingly or not. More often at times youre going to have the most disillusioned people with a lexicon of a drunk jaded middleaged man whos going through a mid life crisis rather than the quiet, reserved player who tries hisher best in assisting your efforts in a win. It can be argued that the game can be won singlehandedly by a skilled player, but its a pipe dream to seek that out, for most of the general population but it does not deter them from doing so, which leads to yet another problemfrustration within the game. People seek glory within it they yearn the temporary recognition it brings, and those players put their teammates beneath them, which ultimately loses them the game. In short there are a lot of different reasons and expectations of the game, which may cause conflicts ultimately losing you the game. Save yourself the trouble and do something else. Edit For those of you who cant math for some reason, k hours over years is roughly games a day assuming its a game is an hour on average. Hate the new update. looks like LOL. omg this SUcks. after reborn this game suck more evry pach. The most fun and rewarding game i have ever played while there are many gripes i still have about the game its mostly about the community. This game will truly test the bonds between you and your friends. Im looking at you, Tony. I do not like this game at all. Its a terrible game. Please stop playing this game. Please send help. Multiculturalism siumlator. Learn Spanish, Russian, and Chinese all from the comfort from your home!. So addictive, My life has been messed up because of this game. An absolute must play. It made me very racist and hate well Russians. There is nothing left to say. couple of games its like noob ish and you will get on a lot, thats why there are bot matches. take a risk in this game if its for your liking. Dont take to heart all of the rubbish people say. They can get quite intense when they rage. I mean, like really. This game is great! It ruined my social life. I now abuse Russians Ive known for years IRL. Anybody whos better than you is a basement dweller. Anybody worse than you is from South America. Possibly the worst community in gaming after LoL. Bad graphics and controls, IGN I have spent too long on this game, and Im by no means the worst offender. I wish I could get those hours and money back.

A game that will suck you in with temporary overdose of dopamine that will reward you with absolutely ing nothin and before you know it you spend thousands of hours decaying in this pile of shitbag. Dont get me wrong, the game in itself is beyond amazing.However the community is some ed up Players who start feeding with their heroes or couriers just because you accidentally took their last hit, and theres nothing you can ing do about it except using your ing puny reports which will literally do nothing. Players who spam ping you for every small mistake you make. Rats that will insult you on a personal level as following Never ever in a game will you find a community as toxic as dota. Too many unchecked slum rats with extra chromosomes resulting from Generations of inbreeding. Guaranteed trashtalking in of games if youre in the trash tier like myself. This game will turn you into a racist scumbag who has banged everyones mother or be the victim of having your mom banged by everyone In the end youll wonder how your kidney is still functioning with all the salt, and wonder if those thousands of hours you played was worth it. Youll question your life choices, youll question your very own existence, and feel like starting your own genocide against a whole race because of all the A Holes you meet in your games. It was fun while it lasted. Just dont get to it, please. Its not worth your time. How to make friends in Dota A detailed guide. Step Start a match Step Write Good luck, have fun guys! Step Get insulted and called an american burger idiot, retard fggot cck putin fcker Step Finish the match Step Wish you never played this game and consider commiting suicide And thats how you make friends in Dota !. An accurate simulation of a Spanish and Russian invasion of the United States. This isnt dota anymore. This Game has ruined my life and caused me to hate a great number of people. make dota great again. dota worst gud bye!. Dota used to be good. Trying to change something that is already perfect will ruin it, undoubtedly. Playing this game now is like trying to be with your girlfriend after she had a session with black guys and you have to get used to her now because its her quoting icefrog here New journey. I used to love this game, it brought me together with so many people, now we are all cringing and debating whether we should uninstall it or raid your headquarters and protest this stupid change. DOTA WAS GREAT. NOW ALL YOU DID IS COPY LEAGUE OF LEGENDS. U FAILED YOUR COMMUNITY. U FAILED YOUR FANS. RIP. So, I decided to try out this Dota and see what all the fuss is about. I can totally see why so many people play it. Very addicting game i put in like hours in like days! Never played a game so much in so little time before. Well, at least since Company of Heroes. Has nice simple graphics that run smooth. Any computer should be able to play this and have no real problem. That in itself makes the game more enjoyable. There is a butt load of heroes to choose and play as. Like pokemon have to play them all. Would probably take days to do. The only con i can think of. There is a lot of annoying people that constantly ping the map, and or complain the whole game. Other then that. I recommend this game, most fun i had in awhile. I cant bealive that i reached h in this game, OMGWTFBBQ. My first game on steam with k hours Morbid mask has lifesteal, but I feel that dota has lifesteal Never start to play it. Edit Almost hours, the most played game from my library and I still sck in it. Do I need any other words for this The Test of Time Award must go for this one Edit Luckly after a year, I still did not pass hours. I feel better now. Dota was fantastic. Dota made it garbage. Looks like the people at valve want to attract the newer generation of year old kids to the game. Understandable thinking, but bad move making it a patch update instead of a new game. Should have just made it Dota and keep Dota the way it was. Sorry Dota, but this is goodbye. This is obviously an exceptionally well made game, and it does make every effort to teach you and integrate you. But I cant recommend it unless you want to really learn how to play, which is a long and slow process. I didnt find it to be all that fun. I only played it for a little bit. Its ok I guess. I only played a little but it was fun. This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers. Then it taught me to hate them all. Its like roulette fun until it turns into Russian. still cant figure out how to jump Things I gave to DotA Money Time Love Things DotA gave me Arthritis Carpal tunnel syndrome Hatred of Russians, Mexicans, Spanish, Finnish, and Russians Broken keyboard Broken mouse ready Server crashes stacks of Russians in EUW servers on English prefrence settings Ranked matches Free to play but Pay to win games I.E.

Some of this is irrelevant to the game today. Also, dont take what is wirtten here personally. Update To all whom think that I copied this off someone elses review, look at the date at which my review was posted and then look at the others. I find it funny that people like my review so much they plagiarize it. Just so you know, I wrote it while on the toliet. One day, a wise man intoduce me into this game. it shall protect your virginity, my lad he said. The best program for learning the Russian language. k edit PS. sucks. I opened DOTA I chose a Peru server I waited minutes Your game is ready Hey, guys, how are you? Bad. Why? Russians. Russians everywhere. We hide here from them. Well, then youve failed. Why? Cause Im Russian We do not believe you. Russians dont write in English. Prove it. c yka And then they all leave and threw me nine reports. This game is really great.

Bots will charge a low HP enemy in the range of an enemy tower, just like humans A great game with a very friendly and tolerant community, its also a very educational and cultural experience. Since Ive been playing dota Ive learned to speak russian and spanish, Who needs rosetta stone when you have dota right? The russians are so friendly and have a neat little nickname for americans called Suukah, I think it means comrade or friend. And the peruvians are so helpful, for instance I was mid as pudge and at the start of the match a peruvian dazzle came mid with me and stayed with for about minutes, He helped me out by taking the last hits and first blood. He said movimiento I think it means I got your back, What a nice guy. Dota is great and all but there are a few problems with some heros, like bloodseeker, Phantom Assassin, Faceless void, And huskar. They need to be buffed, I find them extrememly underwhelmed. Bloodseekers ult cd is just too long and needs to be lowered to ten seconds, Phantom assassin needs a higher crit ratio, faceless needs more evasion and movement speed, and huskars flaming spear should cost no hp. Oh and theres one other hero needs to be nerfed hard, Bat rider is just too overpowered and unbalanced. I think he has too much hp, and the base should be lowered to also lower his base movement speed to Aside from those few problems dota is the best FPS I have ever played in my life. My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about years old when my mother said to him, If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me Dont ever smoke. Please dont put your family through what your Grandfather put us through. I agreed. At I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway. How most of my solo ranked match goes Find match, wait for all people to load up Marked middlelane on my minimap A dude on my team Mid or feed Be a bigger man and give him mid, then i mark safelane Other dude Im gonna carry, trust me, give me safelane ..

My captain picked me meepo against earthshaker, lich and ember spirit would play again THE PUB SUPPORT Where are wards? The pub Carry demanded. I placed them and they were countered the Support began, I am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm, protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more, also possibly sentries to remove their UP COUR PLS the mid hero politely added. Give Savle The Carry demanded. Certainly. replies the support, using the salve on the Carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave. So where is mek? the Carry said, after he was ganked due to overextending. The Support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse. Again, having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards, I dont think a minute Mek is viable. The Support replies. Haha look your level, so low, noob the Carry retorted. U have no item xaxa. Well, jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which I attempted to give you, the carry, the priority over. The Carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower, oblivious to the enemy tp that the Support moved away from. Report Support, usless The carry cried in allchat, in between mentioning various aspects of the Supports Mothers anatomy. Instead of reporting and acting like that, why dont you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry? the Support asked, as he watched the Carry return to afklasthitting lane creeps. HAH, support is for noskill noobs like you! When Bloodseeker gets above a certain move speed he should make Race Car noises. Playing this game on US East made my Spanish grade rise from a B to A.

When I first started DOTA I was a little overwhelmed, as my first ARTSMOBA game it was pretty complicated. I soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying. Before I knew it, I was performing and better. I stopped making silly and got vastly better at not the enemy For the part, everyone Ive met was very helpful and there the however. As play DOTA This game helps you realize the stuggles that were present during the Cold War, and reinforces your fear of Russians, or at least playing with them. Team up with South Americans to battle the Russians and receive more negative feedback from your teammates than your ex girlfriend gave you about your small Once you realize that the South Americans are also your enemies, you can play on their servers to escape them because everyone knows that they only play on the U.S. Servers to slowly damage our mental stability to aid them in their everlasting mission to feel like they dont live in a third world country. Insalled game, Opened game, Found Match, was told to pick an easy hero like sniper or wraith picked sniper, was told to uninstall, told them to foff, won game, reported salty nobsthere are plenty fell in lovewith the game, now have no life and cry myself to sleep at night. awsome more than a game. Dota community is seriously the best Ive ever seen for my entire life. Theyre so concerned with us players to the point that they ask are you blind, are you stupid? Never in my life have Ive seen someone who asked me such thing, it touched my heart. Theyre legit concerned that if Im blind and stupid, probably they want to take me to the hospital if I really am. They even suggest to delete the game as Im playing it too much! Best! So much fun that youll lose your mind and before you know it youve spent hours on it and youre left an empty shell of the person you were. This game is not for the faint hearted. You will be abused, beaten, broken, griefed, tormented and hated on the entire time, and yet you cant stop playing because of the high you get when you win an minute comeback game against mega creeps and divine rapiers. This must be how drug addicts feel. But is it worth it? Dota takes sane men and turns them into vile despicable human beings and you have to play with and against such people on a regular basis. To win you must now become captain of the SS dumbfk and somehow try to convince your teammates fighting the enemy team and not their own is in their best interest.Its also got he highest concentration of DunningKruger patients in the entire online gamming community. Valves terrible low priority system doesnt help. Assuming youre a masochist and you arent deterred by all of the above, you get to experience probably the best free online multiplayer game on the planet. With dota you get...... heroes, items,hundreds of hero strategies, tens of thousands of lane matchups and infinite replayability. You can and will spend years just learning about each of them. Dota has a thriving pro scene with the international giving out the biggest prize pools in all of esports and many regular sports. New patches and compendiums keep the gameplay fresh for most of the year. The latest international had a pick rate of heroes which is a testament to how well the game is balanced. And if youre a gambling man, dota is just the game for you. Introducing more lootboxes than any other game youve ever seen! Want literally any cosmetic in the game? Well there is a lootbox with your name on it waiting to be opened gabeN. Just remember no matter how good you get at dota, youre never good enough....and youll end up chasing the mirage of a high mmr and good players while trodding though mud and ht and you never realize its not real till youre in too deep. Today in International DOTA News More Peruvians are setting their preferred language to English without knowing a single word of it, despair is on the rise. Filipinos are committing mass suicide in ranked matches, shouting what frightened onlookers describe as a wew. Russians agree that the only heroes worth playing in the game are Pudge, Invoker, and Sniper. However Russians themselves have no idea how to play these heroes, and continue to yell incomprehensible profanities in the chats. In other news it seems that Mexicans are causing worldwide panic as they do nothing of value, refuse to supportinitiatecarry, steal vital last hitskills, and feed on teams everywhere. The Mexicans strangely enough, cannot see that what they are doing is not only wrong, but is also making them look worse as a race. And finally the number of English players is decreasing substantially, as many take their own lives after losing match after match while on stack teams of foreigners. This however will hopefully force the now homeless Peruvians and Mexicans into joining the Russian and Filipino servers, so they may kill eachother off at last. Bringing about the death of DOTA and the start of world peace. This has been Russell Stover with your International DOTA News, and This game makes me want to kill myself Pick Tiny Get mega creeps Wait near enemy fountain with teammates Toss teammates into fountain Teammates died Enemies team came back Lost. Got reported. would do it again. i dropped college for this dont play this game, it makes doing meth look healthy Time, Mr Newell? Is it really that time again? Great Russian language simulator. the people in the game are really mean to me, even though im trying as hard as I can they say kill yourself s. s s. s. I dont remember what it is to be happy. This game stole the very memory of it. If you are worried your children are doing drugs, show them this game. They will be too busy fulfilling their innermost masochistic desires while hopelessly right clicking that they will not have the time for drugs or friends or anything else really. Rage inducing, tryhard killing, new swear words learning, this game has it all. Played it for a few hours. Found it boring DotA Will drain you of your will to keep playing, and yet you will always return. DotA Will make you regret ever playing it, and yet you will always think Just one more game DotA Will take away all your free time, and yet youll almost feel proud of how many hours you have in DotA With the time you spend on this game, you could do all sorts. Study on learning a new set of skills to further your career. You could raise money for charity. You could be an aid worker for a foreign country and help improve the lives of others. You could even just play other games, you know, those ones sitting in your backlog, pushed aside by DotA But you wont. You will always return to this game. The maximum you will learn from playing this game is how to insult others in various languages mostly these languages will consist of Russian and Peruvian.. This game will become as much a part of your life as eating or blinking. Half the time you will not even remember having played DotA on a certain day. It just becomes natural to you. If you start playing this game, you become addicted. You will also spend obscene amounts of money on cosmetics. A quick chest purchase here, a few random items on the market there, and boom. Like me youll have spent far too much on a game which needs no money spent on it. If you start DotA not only will you be subjecting yourself to a motivationdestroying hobby, but also subjecting yourself to a wallet emptying one too. tldr This game will take away your time, money and patience for others. You will become an angry person. Basically GOTY All years Worst game in the universe But I still play it I dont know how many times I have uninstalled this game.

Albert CYKA Einstein If I spent those hours learning knitting, I guess Id be pretty good at knitting by now. Instead I spent hours doing this coprophilia and I still cant last hit. EDIT My last year with this game was an endless cycle of remember the good things install dota have the most frustrating game in my life uninstall dota Just dont even start. EDIT On a serious note, DOTA is a great competitive team game that is really fun to play and really fun to watch. BUT it has one of worst communities Ive come across. Public games are a pure pain of time because of this. I spent most of my hours with my friends and even if there was of us, there was still other people on our team who were capable more than enough to ruin the game completely. I am not talking about skill level or gameplay habits but about conduct and morales. Your matches will be repeatedly ruined by idiotic people who cant behave themselves, refuse to cooperate and are not manly enough to admit defeat. No matter how good DOTA is at its core, the time I spent playing such matches was vastly irritating and I am never getting that time back. Heres a list of some pretty standard stuff that youll be dealing with EVERY. GODAMN. MATCH very rarely anyone ever commends you for the good plays you manage that is, if they even notice. if you screw something up, misclick or miss a spell, its gonna be pointed out immidiatelly by your team and they will talk sht to you and shove it into your face for the rest of the match. should you ever raise constructive criticism against someone, no matter how kind words you use, that person will most likely not only refuse to learn from it, they will also start to actively look for any tiniest flaws on your side trying to look more pro than you. there is no such thing as asking for something. People just expect you to do something and then they talk sht to you that you didnt do it. people will constantly blame you for their own mistakes. It will mess with your head even though its obvious the fault is on their side. people will start talking sht to you out of the blue and refuse to tell you the reason why theyre doing it. If theyre total fucing idiots, they will just tell you to watch replay. you will be constantly reminded to uninstall dota. a teammate will seem completely oblivous to your attempts to communicate with them but will gladly say noob when you comment on the fact that they dont cooperate. if youre just having a bad day and your performance is outright bad, your whole team will start a fcking crusade against you. They will start talking the enemy team into reporting you and they will very likely sabotage your gameplay in various ways. at a certain point when victory seems too far, some of these retrds just have a breakdown and will remain afk and just move occassionally to not be autokicked by the game, effectively ruining the match and wasting time of anyone on their team who actually wants to play. if there is no one specific to blame for losing, they will just throw it on the person with the lowest KD. Preferably a healer support hero who rarely gets any kills at all. This list is just a tip of the iceberg. I am constantly losing faith in humanity because of people in this game. If you ever meet someone who doesnt qualify for this list, send them a big hug from me, because its those people who keep me playing somehow. With this in mind, I cannot possibly encourage you to have your precious time ruined by terrible cowardly people who dont understand that griefing and destructive criticisim arent helping anything and can only make matters worse. TLDR DOTA beer selfimprovement. You will curse the day you pressed that install button. Okay, listen. If you are a competetive person, enjoy breaking your limits and achieving goals dont even think of installing this game. JUST DONT ING DO IT. Try learning how to play guitar, salsa dancing, Java programming, anything. But not DOTA. Because after years of playing and more than k matches you wiil feel the same I feel now. It is regret. You will regret all that time you wasted on a computer game that gave you nothing back. Dont get me wrong, this is a great game. It is perfectly designed, it provides an incredibly wide range of emotions. BUT! You will eventually understand, that you could have used all that precious time to make yourself a better human being and already conquire this goddamn world. Instead of hitting creeps, destroying towers and raging on teammates. You might think of esport at some point. But game is not worth the candle. Just sit down and calculate chances yourself if you are seriously considering earning money playing it. If you just want to chill at weekends with friends playing a few matches go for it, this is a great way to do it. But if I were you I would go to a nearby bar and find a good company and some adventures instead, it is far more interesting and profitable. Not recommended. EDIT Nice discussion in comments. Read through it if interested. I never thought I would spend so much lifetime in a game that makes me want to kill myself every time I play it. Please, send help.

I just played a few games ... rly nice but hard game. Slowly i am getting into it... Blame simulator Ruins your social life.Makes you sad and happy at the same time. Recommended for people who do not want a life. Dota is like an abusive relationship. Its not good for you, but you go back to it anyways because its addicting. Youll lose a game, feel bad, play again, then if you win youll feel just content. If you lose again, youll play again. Repeat. There are good moments, there are bad moments, but most of all there are nonenglish speakers in english servers. Fortunately if youre looking to learn foreign swear words, this is definitely the game for you. would cry again.

Lag since the update Late nights People constantly disconnecting cause they have crap internet Breakdown Dota is a greedy gold digging woman, but I still love her will still play Ruined my life and made me a racist. this game,srsly. Youd better play bad rats than this sack o God bless anyone that dares to enter in this cesspool of toxicity Its honestly the absolute worst piece of Ive ever played in my life. I regret every single second Ive spent on it, and I would more readily recommend stomach cancer than this game. If u want cancer, go play it. Great Game! Been playing it since and still one of my favourite game of all time! More toxic than flint water Spent k hours on this game, I could have finished another graduation with this time. Causes brain damage and illiteracy Supporting in dota is like chemistry If its easy youre doing it wrong After wasting my hours on it, i think i can say something about this game. First of all, this review is not a humorous one. Im writing it seriously to give information about this game. Because it is so popular and too many people want to learn something about it including who has never played it and starters. I think this review will be informative for these people, gamers who has spent couple of hours like me, knows everything i am going to try to tell. After this short introduction, we can start Russians problem is not about being Russian. Due to the games popularity among Russian players, there are too many bad always swears, doesnt play as its a team game, doesnt speak english in eu servers etc. Russian players. But there are also too many nice Russian players. Briefly, the problem is not about being Russian, if there are gamers in dota, of them will be bad players, if there are of them. Thats the point. If you want to play this game to get relaxed, dont do it. After few matches you will find yourself more depressed, angry or sick instead of relaxed or enjoyed. The bad players are the reason for it. As an illustriation you started a game to get enjoyed, looked the picks, someone rushed carry heroes without saying anything and suddenly said me mid or me solo etc., ok thats right you are still relax, you picked a support for your team, they somehow fed the enemies, ok still you are relaxed, they started to argue with each other, they started to swear and fed the enemy team on purpose just because of their arguement, ok you are still trying to convince them to stop it but you feel angry, and then you will lose the game. This type of games are not so rare in dota. over games are being played according to this nutshell. Therefore, it is highly possible that you will find yourself in a very bad mood instead of enjoyed after playing dota. Then, why people still playing it too much? Why there is not just bad players in the community now? Because it is addictive. You can not get rid of it. If someone trolls your game, you want to play again and wish to play with better players, if you win the game, you want to win again and increase your mmr, if you lose the game you want to play again to get your mmr back. Shortly, you will want to play again after every game. However, if you are sure that you can stop playing whenever you want, this reason is pointless for you. Meaningless mmr system. When i first heard about mmr system i was quite excited. Because it ideally provides an environment that includes less trolls and bad players. However, the system is completely meaningless. Player profile and skills are same at k,k and k mmr. Once you get your mmr, it is very hard to increase it too much since every win increase it every lose decrease it and as i said before, player profile is same at k k and k, when you have a bad player in your team it is nearly impossible to win that game etc. It is completely up to your team. So, how people get too high mmrs? They have this mmr at the begining. And how they did it? There is no clear information about it. Valve does not announce how it is being calculated. For example, i played first ranked games with wins, i played support and carries, buy wards and couriers when i was support, i carried the game almost on my own when i was carry, but my mmr was when some people get k starting mmr. This system also a fact about this games addiction but doesnt help kind players about creating a better environment. All in all, i dont recommend this game just because of its community. The game is a master piece, master of MOBAs, it is a great thing that only you can spend your money on cosmetic items in the game, it has great graphics etc. However, it has a really bad community and you will find yourself as one of those bad players when you play more and more and it becomes impossible to get rid of it. On the other hand, if you have a great mental power and patience, play it, i completely recommend it. This review was written for normal patience leveled people. I dont say Dont waste your time, go and do some social activities, if u want to play video games, dont play it go and play more enjoying games. Lastly, i have an advice for valve, it would be better if there will be an administrator system in dota. People who works professionally and for money for this administrator job would examine players matches who get reports too much and if they see that they are bad players as defined at the beginning they should be banned from game for few days or their mmrs should be decreased. Now, it is done completely automatic and so after some low priority matches bad players can continue trolling. I hope it would be helpful for people who hasnt spent too much time on dota and it would be read by people except from my friends D Some Suggestions I wrote this review when this game made me feel so bad and desperate. I lost my will to play dota. However then, thanks to some sensitive comments, I started to play dota only with my friends. Now I have some suggestions for people who have similar feelings about dota as I mentioned in my review months ago. As some people say in comments of this review, play this game with your friends. After writing this review I have rarely played solo games and it feels better. Participate in some tournaments. After lots of bad pub match experiences, that tournament atmosphere offers a great dota experience. You can participate in ESLs or other platforms open tournaments for free. Finally,never give up! You can encounter very kind players as well. After a bad pub game performance, your teammates maybe say uninstall dota etc. but after then you can participate in tournaments with your friends. Just do not give any importance what they say. You can see similar things in this reviews comments section. There are very kind, sensitive and suggestive comments which try to help me and lots of depressing, offensive comments. Same is true for the player profile in dota, just dont give any importance what the haters say! Final Note For the guys who say why dont u recommend the game while playing it too much, please read the review again, this review is a complete answer to your question. GOOD LUCK HAVE FUN D UNFORTUNATELY, IO LOST THE ARCANA SHOWDOWN UNFORTUNATELY, IO LOST THE ARCANA SHOWDOWN AGAIN BUT THIS TIME AT FINAL STAGE Edited Game hours are updated and some grammar mistakes are corrected.

Drink Vodka, Win Dotka! Its OK. blame simulator rage simulator angry simulator blood boiling simulator if you have a bad day and want to blame someone play this game if you have a good day and want to ruin it play this game DOTA is my favorite way. The program lets me assume the role of another creature, helping me experience our oneness with the universe. I like to assume the position of the dinosaurriding, lightningwielding, halflizard halfman. I like to join servers with up to nine other disciples, be Disruptor as he is called, and go to the jungle, closing my eyes there I concentrate on my breathing. The other disciples woefully always curse at me. I usually have to mute them. I do so to concentrate on being one with the virtual nature. I cant afford to go to national parks, so this is the best thing. Sometimes I see lots of colorful exclamations points and these PING PING PING PING PING sounds occur around my character. They are beautiful. One time someone said, THE ?! LEVEL DISRUPTOR, BUY COURIER YOU ING RETARD! And the truth is there are many players like him. They arent at peace with themselves. Perhaps if he came into the forest and hummed koans with me, and he had done so as the giant, walking tree, then he would see his greater consciousness. All the negative energy would leave his body, and wed share a moment of experiencing our Buddha nature. In my experience, sessions last about minutes. And initially it did not take long to find a server apparently Ive been moved to lowpriority matchmaking. But thats okay. I just assume the lotus position in my chair and wait patiently. The only downside to this is that sometimes I forget to click the accept button. Decent game, trash players. TRUE STORY AHEAD! If you enjoy playing with kids and ruskies EU servers are infested with them that do nothing but flame and rage, this game is perfect for you. I played this game a lot with my friends until they all became dedicated junglers and forced me to play support of our games. I didnt even get a chance to play some heroes because they were all over me on teamspeak if I did something wrong. I became afraid. Sometimes on LAN parties I actually thought I might not make it back home alive. My friends were chugging Monsters like addicts and eventually they became monsters themselves. It was all about getting to k MMR, and the game consumed them. They changed. Somehow I managed to escape the grasp of this game and now live a happy life. I still play a round every once in a while as a reminder how people can be, and how better person I have became ever since I stopped playing. Mark my words and stay away from this game. If you find yourself in this review and need counseling, feel free to contact me. Peace out. Boo Dota where do I start. This game has ruined my social life, I spend every day on this game, training, waiting, and drinking through my mountain dew, to one day become the greatest. My father said to me, Son, you will never be dondo. I said to my father, Dad, I mid, or I feed. My dad dropped to the ground in tears, screaming at the all mighty gabe newell, begging for his son back, but it was too late, I was already back on dota, at mid, blaming my team for sucking This game is why I wake up, Why I masturbate, why I decide that masturbating while playing is a good idea. Thank you for such an amazing game, without this game I would have nothing to get mad at when I am rock solid. Tired of life Come and waste your life here i like to dress up the people but i dont want them to fight i want them to get along Most realistic Russia simulator. Vodka out of Joining DOTA is like moving to America from another country. As a new immigrant, you will be yelled at, spit upon, called racial slurs that are incorrect to your nationality, and screamed at for being stupid and ignorant. You will be a drain on every match causing the economy of your team to drop with your silly actions. Those who are longtime natives will support your with their skilled labor. You will be given gold to buy things that you dont deserve. After several hundred hours of work, for which you see little to no compensation, you will finally do something right. People will look at you in shock. How did this second rate citizen do so well? Was it blind luck? A miracle? The immigrants who have no desire to assimilate will continue to laugh at you jajajajajaja and shame you, yelling at you in Spanish and Portuguese. But if you keep at it, if you do nothing but play, you will have more of these moments where the real citizens start to treat you as one of their own. Even complimenting, nay, commending you from time to time. On that long road to being a citizen of this new capitalist jungle if you succeed, you will be praised and glorified. You will given wealth and fame. People will watch your every move and pay you money to learn to be you. If you already live in America, and dont want to learn what it feels like to be an immigrant, then you could continue to sit on your entitled white and play Heroes of the Storm.

I now speak different languages. ruined my life. As a colourblind user, the HUD has completely screwed me over. Im having difficulty to differentiate between greyed out skillsitems and coloured readied ones. The HUD itself is poorly implemented. A lot of crucial features is missing unless you press alt, which just further distracts me from the gameplay. I dunno. I see their point on making the HUD more snappyintuitive, but its a step back for me Im gonna go detailed on this one sorry for bad english This is my opinion of Dota Community When people supporting the team as a support hero. First minutes enemy dewards WARD WARD WARD WARD WARD WARD WARD AGAIN no response in seconds tang ina no support When killing an enemy OI KILL STEAL I NEED MONEY DUH DO SOME SUPPORTING this one really get in my nerve When i take Bounty rune Carries GG im not gonna be fat When i try to be a nice carry When picking heroes Me Picking riki Hehe can someone support?

SHUT UP GG NOOB When i try playing mid When enemy first blood you GG mid ill report When you decide to farm a little more GANK LA STUPID report this mid noob Zero respect for the newbies keep calling them noobs dont play uninstall dota wont change a thing Anyway. Toxic deadly not inspiring full of hate words Community. Dont try this game if you cant control your self theres plenty game in steam that with great community. Game The game itself are great you can choose one from heroes with different skill set and animation. What make Dota fun and addictive because the knowledgehardskill about dota that you got from experiencing a lot of playing or someone taught you used to defending your Ancient Or your HQ and destroying theirs.While doing this you canand must collaborate with your other teammates with different heroes and skill set to try make the best OffenseDefense. Really really enjoyable if you play with your friends or family. Well guess now what if you got a toxic teammate dont bother ganking together, make one mistake may get you reported and mocked Tips if you want enjoy Dota for a long time Make sure you have friendfamily playing it too.If you ever play a Single game and you met this stranger with fun attitude,forgiving yet teaching ,know ways of dota, commend them and dont scared to ask if they want to be your Steam friend.Because kind like them are extremly rare. Its like getting Mew in Pokemon Gameplay Fun Community Play it with friends or family Overall for me Feel free to comment on agree or disagree i will respond Remember, Dont be A hate in Dota Dear Boys Girls! The most fantastic game that improves skillset used in everyday life! After a couple of hours I already got the hang of the game. It is a real rewarding piece with a beautiful community that is keen on helping you improve and unleash your hidden potential. Even though Ive achieved the highest Badge possible in the game which is also a great and original idea to somewhat categorize players, I am still reminded daybyday that Im pretty new to the game and I should focus on polishing my skills, which is a huge help since I am somewhat a maximalist. The Dev Team is amazing and fast to reply in cases of bugs, broken things throughout the game that would otherwise alter the potential outcome of important Ranked Matches. I would highly recommend it to people thinking about taking up a semester abroad or such since it does help You enourmously when it comes to foreign languages. After just years I was fluent in Russian and Spanish even though I have never taken a class before and this allowed me to travel to St Petersburg and Barcelona taking my language skills to the next level. Its easy to make friends, people have no prejudice when it comes to your Badge, Divine highest rank in the system players play with Heralds lowest rank in the system and enjoy spending some free time with their fellow bratushki. I would also like to thank Valve for the amazing support towards amateur and semiprofessional teams, the sponsoring of various national tournaments all over the globe and the ability to connect with each other in real life through this amazing franchise. The game rewards You trying really hard to win games and works on pushing you even further. The higher your impact in games, the lower impact people it will match with you, resulting in you having to push even harder. Amazing! Understand people from all over the globe through simple words, hieroglyphs, and ancient text. Being able to acquire and share information in a new and intuitive way. Some people take the role of the good soldier and some that of the leader. With Power however comes Great Responsibility. You are ready to make calls and lead your team towards victory? Keep in mind that you will also be accounted for the consequences of a miscall. But in the end you will become more daring and even better at leading with example! The more you play the more advanced you become and analysis, prediction and understanding of movement and thoughts of people you have never met before. Paired with your glorious Communication Skills you will be able to share and respond to any situation. You will effectively be able to see the future as it is! While most games are circa minutes long, in some games you spend a wonderful hrs time together with other nice people who you learn to know during this experience. The longer the game lasts however, the harder it becomes since any small mistake you make can be the end of the struggle. You acquire the ability called Laser Focus eyes on the goal, maximum efficiency, error factor. High level players have iron nerves! As human beings we must understand that sometimes we win and sometimes we learn. After lost games we still are eager to learn from our mistakes, commend the people that accounted for the win on the opposing team and pat the weaker players on the back. Standing up after a failure is a key factor in creating something new, in evolving. DotA is a major enhancement in this area. Give it a try, enjoy your time and who knows we might meet in game! Cheers, Dont waste yo time its ok for a few hours i guess. Russian speaking simulator If youre looking for reasons to kill yourselves this is the perfect game. Got to believe in magic Tell me how players find each other In a server full of cancers farming simulator then feed simulator but stilll playing lel pubs scrubs How to make friends in Dota A detailed guide. Step Start a match Step Write Good luck, have fun guys! Step Get insulted and called an american burger idiot, retard fggot cck putin fcker Step Finish the match Step Wish you never played this game and consider commiting suicide And thats how you make friends in Dota I cant willingly recommend this game to anybody and go to sleep at night knowing what I did. The best way to describe my relationship with this game is that I hop on discord almost every night after renting cars to awful people, and ask my canadian friend if he wishes to suffer with me. He will begrudgingly say yes and so we will join. We are paired with screaming, knuckle dragging south americans who also equally hate themselves, and then indulge in the most masochistic and unpleasent videogame experience you could ever imagine. You can spend minutes solid winning, and then one mistake turns the whole thing up on its head. But what is the worst part? You will never be satisfied. If you win you just nod your head sadly, because you know an hour of your life is gone forever, if you lose, you just laugh at yourself and shrug, saying what did I expect, look what I am doing with myself. You can never get that hour of your life back. The cycle repeats every night, forever. If you hate yourself, you will find solace in the fact that you have a safe way of reliquishing your pain. Truly only the mad, the self loathing, the angriest, and the stupidest people play dota willingly. If you count yourself amoung those, I welcome you to the community. Welcome.. welcome to the dumpster...where you belong. Dota yes, the game that makes you go WTF is this load of horse on your first game, and go total ape when you finally get your first kill. A game that will suck you in with temporary overdose of dopamine that will reward you with absolutely ing nothin and before you know it you spend thousands of hours decaying in this pile of shitbag. Dont get me wrong, the game in itself is beyond amazing.However the community is some ed up Players who start feeding with their heroes or couriers just because you accidentally took their last hit, and theres nothing you can ing do about it except using your ing puny reports which will literally do nothing. Players who spam ping you for every small mistake you make. Rats that will insult you on a personal level as following Never ever in a game will you find a community as toxic as dota. Too many unchecked slum rats with extra chromosomes resulting from Generations of inbreeding. Guaranteed trashtalking in of games if youre in the trash tier like myself. This game will turn you into a racist scumbag who has banged everyones mother or be the victim of having your mom banged by everyone In the end youll wonder how your kidney is still functioning with all the salt, and wonder if those thousands of hours you played was worth it. Youll question your life choices, youll question your very own existence, and feel like starting your own genocide against a whole race because of all the A Holes you meet in your games. It was fun while it lasted. Just dont get to it, please.. Its not worth your time DOTA helps you realize the uselessness of the real world. I now know how futile it is to have a girlfriend, a college degree, a job etc.. All you need is a bunch of tangoes, some branches and clarity, and the world is all yours. League of Russia Suffering Welcome to the Salty Spittoon. How tough are you How tough am I I play Dota Yesterday. Yeah, so With Russian, and manage to won the game. Right this way sir, sorry to keep you waiting cancers everywhere Play EU servers Play SEA servers PUTANG INA BOBO! Play local servers ASU DANCOK! get feed for people who want to explore and delve into the dark abyss that is the human mind While playing this game you might as well move to Russia after a couple of hundred hours Dota Plus? EA says hi. Very fun game! Highly recommended. Pros Very Fun Makes Friends Learn Foreign Languages Cons Makes you Racist Sucks up your Time Makes you angry Get High Blood Pressure Infinite Toilet you Throw Monies in Makes you a Hateful Person Possibility of Carpal Tunnel Highly Recommended Dont do it! Walk away from this game now. This game is meth, rotting teeth and all. What you THINK this game is players working together to win, using various tactics and communication. Youve seen some pro player highlights maybe, and you want to be in that mix of battle. What this game really IS angry gamers that are addicted to this broken game, and want to make your life suck. Dont believe me? Look at the new player summary, the DEVs have literally locked new players away from the toxic trash that inhabits this game. If youre still not sure, the DEVs have made it that your first games, you are only matched with players with consistently high behavior ratings. So, of the population. Who you will never hear from again once off your game training. They also keep you away from the stupid carry set up they have going. A carry is a hero that can v the enemy after minutes of farming nonstop without fighting almost at all. So you might be rumbling in lane all match, inching up those kills and pushing the lanes... then minutes clicks over and here comes their carry. Lets assume your carry isnt ready or just sucks. This is the internet, so that person is on your team, despite randomness. So your slow, grudging win that you were minutes away from? Now that carry kills your whole team by themselves, without ever needing help. Ooops! And now theyve destroyed your base. And that doesnt cover the cowardly, who dont know that theyre cowardly. It might be you! They stand in the background of fights, holding their heavyhitting ability ready, waiting for the enemy to get low HP so they can swoop in to kill. Its satisfying! But it also means the v fight is really v bc someone is not participating. Usually the man team will win out, and the coward in the back? They start runningtoo late! The enemy has gap closers and run them down, killing them also. Like I said, these players dont even know theyre doing it. Theyre thinking why couldnt my team do a better job and wear the enemy down so I could finish them off?! People will rage. They will die purposefully to throw the game feed. They dont speak English and are angry about that for some reason. You CANNOT LEAVE the game during an hour long match. And it is an hour long. Every time. So what you think you are getting into is a wellorganized battle game, like a highlytrained football team out there on the field what you are really getting into is an unsupervised playground for little kids. There is screaming, bullying, someone pushing someone off the slide, someone throwing pine cones at his friends, a weird kid staring off into space. Why people play this game? Becuase were idiots and think next game, Ill have a good team. and I screwed up that build, Ill try again! Or maybe I need a new hero, that one sucked! And you cannot change this outcome by yourself. No matter what you do. Your team wins when they are selfless and work to let the carry farm mindlessly all match. You lose because someone or everyone on your team was selfish or just angry at the world take a guess how many people that is on the internet.... This is an hour long game. You CANNOT leave. The trolls and jerks usually start screaming or typing insults by minutes into this. You CANNOT leave. The guy that doesnt speak English is now mad because people are calling him names he vaguely recognizes, so he starts feeding on purpose for the rest of the hour long game. You CANNOT leave. The opposing team realizes that you have the team that is falling apart faster than theirs, so they start typing NOOBS and EZ! in all caps every minutes as they kill you repeatedly. And as they kill you, they get more gold, more xp, and the process steamrolls to the point where you cannot make a comeback by the minute mark... the loss is complete... after the full hour the winning team doesnt want to end early, theyre enjoying their fleshed out heroes destroying yours. You CANNOT leave. Walk the f away and send me a Xmas card as a thank you. All cancers can be cured except SEA cancer. Worst game ever Enters game Chooses Hero Types GLHF mins later, the enemy replies EZ noob tang ina In summary, its a great game to play with the right people but mostly you will meet uncivilized trash talkers. The pros and cons down here Cons Toxic community Infested with players who dont know how to speak proper english Insane learning curve Rage Simulator Teamwork is a joke Everyone wants to be that guy who carries your team to victory.

Split second math ReliableUnreliable gold and gold loss on death vs. Buyback availability This is good too Essentially DotA is a greedy woman, but I love her all the time. would play again So, here are some limericks about Dota that may help you decide whether to play or not... Sorry in advance There once was a man named zeus His team put him mid on the loose He could totally But had no escape and so he got ganked like a moose One time Pugna I tried to play But forgot that there is no way To get more than five health Without massive wealth And bounty hunter stuck his peepee in my bum over and over and over and I cried Sometimes if there is a dragon You need to purchase a dagon And then you go ZAP And all cross the map People made the excuse they were laggin Nyx nyxnyx nyx nyxnyx nyx Nyxnyx nyx nyxnyx nyx nyx nyx Nyx nyx nyx nyx Nyx nyx nyx nyx nyx Nyxnyx nyx nyxnyx nyx nyx nyx There once was a brave little feller Who wanted to be the best speller But he was russian And people are s So now he lives in a cellar There once was a brave little a bear Who smoked into Roshans lair So hard he tried But he got bashed and died And now his team is giving him the glare If you play dota beware Because its sometimes a pit of dispair Advice you will heed But your teem will still feed And then you will switch to solitair So I just wasted a solid minutes making jenky limericks about dota... Just play the game, its awesome This is the best MOBA game ever made, simply a masterpiece, but also has one of the worst communities. I sometimes end up frustrated, tired and in a bad mood when i cant win a single game in hours of straight gameplay just because of bad players who get in your games to ruin them. Theyrere not just noobs, they just love trolling and ing up others people fun. If youre noob and wish to play Dota, make sure you have patience and time. Becoming good in this game is really hard, takes years to master and youll never get to call yourself a pro. If you decided to start Dota, DO NOT play online. Practice with bots first, read guides, read items and abilities descriptions first, you got to study before playing in a real game with humans. It can be very frustrating for old players to deal with people that simple come to try out a new game into their matches and ruin them. Please. Someday you will realize what i mean with this. I play DotA since Dota and I have hit my keyboard, laughed, yelld to my girlfriend for no reason and even let my bad mood affect my scores in school because instead of studying math, I decided to stay late playing and made me lose time I could spend with friends. Lost many good stuff I could have done outgame because I said One more match... which became more matches... and ended up totally frustrated without winning one of them, unable to sleep well those nights. Due to this, to the careless community and the fact that your mood can be affected by DotA and how it makes you feel, i cant recommend this game. Dota is not just another game to your library. You have to be very careful when you decide to play this. Dont get me wrong ive always wanted to learn a new language and thx to dota now i speak fluent bliyat This game has caused me to have a legitimate hatred for anything South American. I have HOURS Normal Garbage Ranked Garbage Custom Games Decent Ive supported percent of games Ive attempted to keep calm Ive attempted to do everything in my sanity to enjoy this. If you want you play this having some sort of fun or enjoyment play with friends. Thats the only reason I play this now. This is the pure honest truth of someone who has attempted this. You think MMR matters. You think stats matter. You think only you matters. Thats the only thing I ever see. Its a matter of fact that Im addicted to this game at times. Ive had games playing with the dumbest idiots being my friends yet those games Ive had more fun in being the stupid stuff we do or how we mess around them being half drunk and laughing. Thats how Dota should be. Drunk and having fun. Something this community cant understand No matter how much you try, how good you get it wont get better. I cant recommend this game because of what it has done to me as a person and how half of the hours in game Ive spent in anger rather than at least mild amusement. Anyone from pros to rookies can agree honestly on this one thing. this game Too much water ruined my life Its a fun game, but it will tear your soul out if you arent careful. Also a free but rather rage inducing Roseta Stone. Learn up to languages today! This review is totally honest. I spent hours upon hours on this game. It was a horrific and quite a sad journey to reach the not bad skill bracket. Everything in this game, from the toxic community to the rage I have had to endure for this game was difficult and nearly impossible for me to accomplish but i did. After the hours, I questioned myself, what did I do this for? The fame and money or the fact that the game is so addicting that I chose to play hours of DOTA before my exam. The result was an E grade which is not bad...Is it??. Could it be that I watched TI and TI and was inspired to make my mark on the aegis of champions. Whatever the reason, my family despised me for what i had become. In short DOTA is a game which is not free to play. It requires you to sell your soul to the devil Valve and leave your current life for you to become a legend. Dota is an ARTSMOBA. Although its a video game, it taught me a lot about what to do in the real world! Communication Before Dota Hey dude how you doing? Doing pretty well thank you After Dota Hey dude how you doing? you noob Work Before Dota Employed After Dota Unemployed Other Games Before Dota Lel I got games in my library play hours a day After Dota Lel I got game in my library play hours a day Relationships Before Dota Girlfriends After Dota Hero Cosmetics Political Views Before Dota Immigration is GREAT the United States couldnt survive without it! Let in those Hispanics! After Dota ING PERUVIANS TAKING MY MONEYS KILL EM ALL DONT LET EM IN DONALD TRUMP BIBLETHUMP Final Verdict Would feed again. no io arcana, more like no guy buy Doto should be used in schools to teach the student russian, portugese and spanish. this game is awful i have no idea why i play it In this game you can Murderer trees Kill an ancient creature chilling in his cave without mercy and and steal his cheese Learn at least different languages in every single match Kill others players for no apparent reason Can develop erectile dysfunction due to extended seated hours I usually play this game to relax and wind down because of its super nice community. It calms my spirit to be told to get rekt and neck yourself you feeder nub. I especially enjoy it when super awesome pro players stream the games to twitch and say that their viewers are laughing at me. Classic banter. Every now and then Ill give back some playful jabs but Im not very imaginative. My favourite lines are ill wear your skin kunt and your whorsish mother will taste your blood tonight stain Classic banter TLDR Dont even start! Toxic community, destroys your life. edit dont miss out on the comments of this review! The first time I played Dota was years ago when it was still on WC. I stopped playing for some years and got back to playing since last year. Two reasons why you should avoid this at all cost Toxic community the worse out there! It is almost a given that someone on your team or the enemy team will start some aggressive flaming for no good reason. Racist remarks are the norm. Whenever somone dies, someone else gets blamedflamed. Extremely toxic! After enough hours of gameplay, this type of exposure is bound to spillover on you and give you a very negative outlook of life. What I noticed in me and my friends is that this blamingflaming culture influences us that we tend to unknowingly flame others back in response. Definitely not the kind of person I want to be. Dont expose yourself to such negativity in life! While the gameplay is amazing, keep in mind that this game is highly addictive. I once told my friend that he can do so many other things in life if he doesnt play dota. His response was If i dont do other things in life, I can dota more. I feel like this is the best way to describe how addictive this game can be. He plays at higher level games k MMR. He has since stopped, and Im so proud of him. Before, he used to play all day for over hours until am in the morning. Neglected college and everything else. I fell into that same rabbit hole. I averaged hours a week of dota. Totally soul sucking and toxic. I started having to hide this addiction and not tell others because of the shame of spending so much time on a video game. Neglected college and life. I stopped going out, stopped socializing. Most of the interaction I encounter everyday is from the toxic community. You can imagine how much I degraded. Because this addiction took over my life, I feel that my mental state of mind is so poor now. Low confidence in doing everything else because of all the time wasted in dota. So, this is kinda like my confession here. A way to help me break out of this, and a reminder to not relapse into such a unhealthy and pathethic state of living. Do yourself a favour and focus on real life, which matters and lasts. Dont waste hundreds and thousands of hours on this game that will not add to anything in your life it will only bring you negativity. Live life to the fullest. Time is the one thing you can NEVER get back. Do not regret. this game is awful i have no idea why i play it A good way to stay in the bubble longer than you probably should. I have been playing this game for miserable years and m wrinting this review as an advice. To whom it may concern.. Uninstall this game and run for your life before its too late. Maybe the reader now giggling and drawing an image on hisher mind says this guy is a nerd. No im not, Im a fitness guy with good shape studying engineering, which I had a social life in the past I lost too much things on my life most of them are privacypersonal things not going to write them down but one of them is my education years old still studying engineering because of this game. If you are going to say that you can manage your day between playing DOTA and studying or working you are wrong because the average match time is min only match. So min games per day min. Not mentioning that some games exceed hour if both teams played well. Please take this as an advice from years old guy who has been suffering for years because of this game I sucked on education you can be better than me and quit, I destroyed my dream and now im trying to bring it back wish me good luck. Please this is not a joke post and this advice aiming on teenagers who want to achieve their future dreams just dont play this game its in AWESOME game but you have to pay your life for it. Your choice life or Dota and this is not a joke if you throw my words away just please save my comment on your favorites and come back after years dont cry if your life got ruined. Save my comment if you dont want to take my advice you can visit this comment again. Most of positive reviews are written by Valves agents believe me. HalfLife died for this. Bring me back my time pls after playing h on diffrent accounts i came up with this fact, dont play ranked as long as you have family and your life to care for. I think many good game. My favorite is dtidehunter, he is p cool. He can spit water and summon tentacle army. And enemy so afraid they jump into the air while you kill them all. But teammatees always steal kills and do nothing. Never give donkey wings or buy vision sticks. And Joffy always scream I noob, but otherwise p nice game of nice. meatballs. The objective of this game is to spend all your paycheck on virtual clothing for your favorite characters so you can play dressup with them while looking better than the enemy team. Playing the game itself is completely optional. After nearly games, which means unique teammates and unique opponents, I can personally certify and guarantee that at least of these people are not worthy of the air they breathe or the water they drink. This game is a testament to how the vast majority human beings possess selfishness beyond limits and stupidity beyond measure. The community of this game is evidence that we truly live with a coddled generation of children who were raised to believe that they are special and unique and superior to all other people and can literally do no wrong. The vast majority of people who play this game would benefit greatly from having the beaten out of them. This is a game where you will meet so many types of ppl Also if you play this game youll be depressed Start playing since beta and its actually free, But suddenly fell into Gabens trap and ended up spending on treasure and left with Well worth it if you ask me.

There is no quality fun you cannot get more quickly and efficiently elsewhere. This is an addiction which reduces your productivity, attention span, and freetime. You are becoming more bitter, narrowminded, haughty, and old. Quit now and delete this game. There is nothing here but slow, lonely suicide. People do not have fun here. Players do not communicate succesfully with one another, they nitpick mistakes with witty remarks and mock each other. Nobody is interested in the truth people are battling for fleeting moments of superiority. Players are loud jackasses who tumble into one argument after another, anxiously waiting for you to respond to ensure they keep the last word every time. A fair and balanced match is one in ten thousand, and no matter how hard you filter those matchmaking options you are still searching for diamonds in a garbage dump. This game is not making you happy. You are not having fun. You are not gathering fun experiences to tell, learning, or growing as a person. Instead you rage every thirty minutes and are occasionally spurred to rage quitting by russian teammates who believe they won the Cold War. You are addicted to readily available fun and pressure free social interaction. This game is slowly poisoning you with misogyny, antisemitism, narcissism, a false dichotomy surrounding progamers, and insecurity. Im not telling you to get good. Im not telling you to go outside. Im not even telling you to make friends. Just quit DOTA. Do anything else. i cant stop ruined my life Its a good game, however I dont like the recent changes. And the fact that you have to learn russian to understand most of the players. Ive spent years and almost hours playing Warcraft III DotA as well as Dota and loved playing it. Ive met many interesting people, fought epic battles, snatched victory from the jaws of defeat through several Herculean efforts, endured many soul crushing defeats, and even clashed with a handful of professional players. The game has changed drastically over my many years of playing, but as of about a year ago, the game became too frustrating to continue, and as I continue to watch, I am saddened by what the game has become. For years my friends and I have joked about the Leagueification of Dota. Dota has always been the epitome of hyper competitive cooperative gameplay, with a high emphasis on individual skill and decision making at all phases of the game, especially in punishing poor decisions. Pushing a tower alone with nobody showing on the map? Get back or youre dead. Hard carry dies past minutes without buyback? Thats a barracks down. Pick crappy laning heroes? Welcome to hell while the enemy team runs a trilane and pushes barracks at minutes. Our jokes slowly but surely became a reality. Teleport scrolls were reduced in cost, meaning everybody rolled around with a handful because they werent a financial burden. Ways to gain gold were increased, so supports could afford to have a handful of items in the mid game. The rubber band effect was introduced, and pushing strategies were neutered. You pick a lineup to take towers and take one unfavorable engagement and the games over, whereas previously the greedier lineup would have to do more work than a single fight to overcome the gold advantage. The cost of boots was reduced, taking boots first strategies from a sure sign that you were bad to a viable strategy. Strong laners also got pushed out. Dominating the early game became effectively irrelevant as killing giant money bag heroes in the midgame would slingshot the trailing team into the lead. The worst casualty has been the versatility of the game. Metas change and stuff goes in and out of favor, thats fine and fair, but certain aspects have become imperative to have. A support with a hard save, a hard carry that can fight in the early mid game. Bad laning heroes can just be sent mid, while traditional skill mid heroes are just sent to the safelane. When you take a big lead, the plan is almost always just farm out the map until you cant possibly lose when taking the high ground, as taking a risk will not just result in you losing a fight, but most likely the lead. The game that I grew up with that punishes the smallest mistakes is a distant memory, and we are left with a mid game brawler. I wish Dota the best as it progresses, but the core mechanics have been changed so drastically that I can neither play nor watch it without feeling like something that was once an unrelenting niche game has been formed to cater to the whims of the massive casual audience that it has attracted. I only play it once every day for years My blood pressure before playing My blood pressure after playing The salt is real. Recommended. Dota then MMR is just a number Dota now MMR is just a medal My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about years old when my mother said to him, If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me Dont ever smoke. Please dont put your family through what your Grandfather put us through. I agreed. At I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me CANCER anyway.

But these tips might not always work. If, say, there is a person who dares to speak against you even when you are strictly following everything listed above, you will have to use this final tip that I am going to provide to you. Problem fixed. game including updates community including myself Quit playing. Try to be a better person. This game ruined my life I recommend everyone to play Dota and not LoL nor HoN. Dont get me wrong, I am not hating or anything. I was from HoN for like years before Dota was released and tried LoL and actually enjoyed it for a bit but then went back to HoN. Dota is a great game, an awesome game. I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say. Mechanics are well designed, what makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. This is a team game people, so team work is a must unless you are solo queuing, then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around. Monster gamers are real. Dota has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday, and that.. This game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds. A mere game that brings people together, not just friends but complete strangers too. Dota is a game that will never be forgotten. All in all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better. P.S. Calm down, its just a game.. Best Soviet Union Simulator out there people who like dota will like this one. Very toxic community I think players of this game keep sharing my mothers private number, everyone seems to have had sex with her... Oh yea and about the game...Very good. it ok Well if you broke up with your girlfriend and having pain, start playing this game. You will face with drunks and russians and that makes you cancer. So that cancer will make your pains end shortly. Kann jetzt russich von vodka bis Aber unter der Brcke hat man einfach kein gutes Internet. Since I was a baby, I always had a brain tumor. The doctors told my parents that I wont last til Im years old. A doctor told my parents that they should just give up and let me die sooner through euthanasia. But my parents didnt give up. I experienced growing up, being a normal son and a normal student in a school. Unfortunately, I am now and nearing the end of my life expectancy. I have been fighting against my brain cancer for over a year. But thank god, I played this game. My cancer has been cured.

I take pubs just as seriously as if it was finals at TI. I never give up. Playing against megas? I keep playing. Down kills? I keep playing. Half of your team afk in base? I keep playing. Why? Because Im Antimage. This hero is the ultimate v hero. If played correctly you literally cant lose with this hero. You may be thinking that if you played any hero correctly then you cant lose either but thats simply not true. Antimage is unique with this characteristic. I go safelane. I farm. The offlaner tries to contest but I am too good. I blink on him. I trade. I back off. We both salve up. Hes got no mana. Ive won the lane, like always. I am Antimage. Nothing matters more than farm. I control the lane. Im farming so close to my tower that Im impossible to gank. I can not die. I will never die. minutes. Battlefury, Power treads, Poor mans shield, Vladmirs Offering. Ive already won. Nothing can stop me now but myself. I am fearless. I push out lanes. I take towers. I force rotations. I am Antimage. Thousands of calculations going on in my head.

Manta, Heart, Butterfly, Abyssal. Ive not finished farming. ing AM picker, no skill The flame only fuels me. Wow, nice work AM you took racks I dont need your praise peasant. Im ing Antimage.

GPM. Pathetic, I could do better. Im not trying hard enough. Ive failed. Match found. I pick Antimage. I am Antimage. Its like hardcore drug use and it destroys lives. Give it a go, whats the worst that could happen? Well, you could be here game hours later hating yourself as you queue for another all pick. Send help. As in TP bottom because theyre five manning. I started playing this in and I managed to finally quit it in Dota was my life and I have never played any other moba game. There were days where I wake up, play dota, fall asleep and repeat. NIGHTMARE. In summary If you bring good friends to a party you will enjoy the game and it will be time well spent. If you are going to play it solo queue you will start hating the mankind and your soul will slowly decay. Thanks to dota now i can speak peenoise play hours still suck at this game once u uninstal this game, more easier to install it again even if u try hard to not play this game, u still watch dota wtf on youtube.... goodbye, mr. freeman WHY HAVE I DONE THIS edit this game sucks, if you run a ViperSilencer dual offlane i hope u burn in hell tbh I played this game for a little. It was okay. Stage Meeting The first time was very exciting i knewed nothing about this game but it thrilled me. Stage Chase I wanted to know more about Dota. The Drugs kicked in.

Stage Tolerance You accept the unbalanced game. min games everyday. What is the meaning of life Stage Downhill Time to leave. Mother Nature is waiting for me. Harambe. The thing goes skrrrrra, pa pa ka ka ka If your looking for a review on this game youve come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe youve come to the right place. Ingredients tablespoons unsalted butter cup white sugar cup brown sugar cup water teaspoon cinnamon pinch salt apples peeled, cored and sliced pastry for doublecrust pie Directions Preheat oven to degrees F degrees C. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. Roll out half the pastry to fit a inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate pour in apple slices. Roll out top crust into a inch circle. Cut into inch wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. Pour buttersugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. Bake in the preheated oven for minutes. Reduce heat to degrees F degrees C, and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, to more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing. Enjoy! After watching some videos on YT and VODs on twitch from the game decided to give it a try. Installed, looks fine. Tutorial, ok good idea, I need to see what I am going into, a hundred or so heroes and a million items, pretty tough to get by, but ok. Some games against bots, ok I can see how the mechanics work, so far so good. After a few games with bots the game reccomends multiplayer, ok lets give it a try. It only allows to pick the easier heroes for the first games, good idea since I dont know what I am doing exacly. Lets do this! ... I got matched agains players with like games each and reccomendations whatever that is, it was never explained.., get owned, lose. Ok probably got in this particular game by accident, some new player was queing with a friend that played already or something, no big deal, lets try again. Nope, the same thing for another games or something and only ones I will play since I am uninstalling, got matched with only experienced players.. So I got called a noob a lot and to git gut after saying that I am a new player and this is my first game, I am sure I ruined the game for my team by sucking and the enemy got a free win from me sucking at the game. Like seriously.. what the fk is this matchmaking, if I were ever to git gut how would that go, I would ruin another games for my team by being bad until finally I dont suck that bad and can contribute a little.. and then I get matched with a new player into my game and he ruins the game for me, I dont think so, dont have the nerves for this. That is why I cannot recommend this game if you are a new player stay away, you will not have a good time. TLDR The new player experience for this game sucks giant balls, if you are a new player you will not have fun. In this game you can Murderer trees Kill a ancient creature chilling in his cave without mercy and and steal his cheese Learn at most different languages in every single match Kill others players for no apparent reason Can develop erectile dysfunction due to extended seated hours Pros Learned Russian Learned of entire world are Russians Learned how to communicate with emoticons Learned how to get trolled Learned how to avoid RANKED button Learned world is not fair Learned C Y K A btw. Cons C Y K A Decent game, worlds saltiest players. Would never play LoL ever again. All heroes are balanced, some heroes are just more balanced than others. I have over hours and I want to kill myself. Thanks icefrog! Angry russian simulator Cancer but still playing.... ...................... ....................,.. ....................... ................ ........................ .................. ... ............................... ....................... .......................... .............................. this game This is an amazing, dynamic game. Ive met more friends on here than through any other game. But its addictive as hell. Ive found myself being lulled into a sense of comfort just by the ambient sounds. I see a jester somewhere and automatically want to play as Rubik, and I have an urge to start the game up. You will judge everyone else you play this with, you will mull over every little second of a minute game, and itll make you a horrible pathetic person. Theres no reason to play this unless you need a time sink thatll come around to having a measure of control of your life. Theres single player games where you go one more turn and it turns into a nights afair of staying up late. But this game you start planning a whole day around raising your MMR by points. Why? Because if you managed it, itd make you feel better. What other games does your mood revolve around whether you play well, and how many other games can you name where youd take that feeling good to the point of willingly sacrificing an entire day to it? Unless youve got a team of people to play with, and you dont care how much you suck, or youre actually a progamer with an active team looking for a transition, dont waste your time. Theres plenty of other things to do with literally days of your life. Just follow these rules to play DOTA Make sure you have an intimidating nickname ex EZ RAMPAGE Pick mid carry or gay offlaner that u have GOODEXPENSIVE set Say something scary CapsLock ON LET ME MID..TY or I GO SOLO BOTTOMTOP Predict win! Just lasthit like a pro spamming S Buy midas early and spamming We Need Wards! even u get rekt.. When u feed just type WTF LAG, when u got kill killsteal remember to laugh on all chat HAHAHAHAHA When u lose the game just blame support and when u win the game just say EZ GAME Very simple game,, y Rate Thank you for reading this. This is how I lost my faith in humanity This is how I think whats DotA in many peoples eyes Its ALWAYS happening in every one or two games Blame your support Blame your carry Blame your teammate if youre losing Blame your enemy if your teammates are your friends Pause then unpause automatically Boast when youre winning even if youre feeding the entire time EZ I know its not anyones fault its like this But Valve please? Can you fix the community? Give them something harsh punishment This kind of things are just like cyberbullying.. Made someone depressed I know I know its just a game right? But you can see the effects for the people Theyre unleashing negative energy to other people so they can unleash it to other people again until this community became the most Toxic community I mean seriously years ago, DotA community just not that bad.. Its friendly in fact! Maybe its because everyones learning? And trying to learn together is fun? Teaching one and another, made a DotAs friendly community But now the community, almost made everyone sick of it Valve, please give them a proper harsh punishment so they wont repeat their wrongdoing again again I just saw too many wrong things, but no proper responses from Valve I know Valve just want to make money and more money But please.. Cant you at least give some attention to your games? I know Valve cant count until so this will be the last game At least make it a good memory for all the players Heres a very simple thing for example, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD Thank you truly from their heart? Thank you for supporting us Thank you for carrying us Thank you for hanging in there Thank you for handling the mid nicely Thank you for buying us wards courier Thank you for teaching me where I did wrong Or something like that Its ok everyones fail at one time Not everyones perfect Youre doing a good job! Have you ever done that? Have you ever heard that? No? Well thats Dota community for you Did you imagine how Dota is now if all of people that playing Dota have done that? At least more enjoyable to play.. right? Well reality is cruel If you want to start play this game I dont recommend it playing with people I dont even recommend to play this game with your friends.. Its bad enough that itll make you lost your friends... or is it a good thing because youll know theyre fake friends or not? Most of them are bad people, dont have manner or even humanity You can play it with bots though, theyre more encouraging friendlier to newbie players Please for your sake Stay away from this game Especially from the community One of many proofs Game is good, but the community is the big problem I dont recomend playing this game if you dont know russian language. I suck at this game yes First and foremost, I would like to thank Steam for giving me a way to call out all raging idiots blaming others. Steam Thank you for all your support! Check out my Dota Stats, Im ing awesome. Following my simple guide, you will be on your way to dealing with baddies and becoming awesome, like me. One of the worst communities ever, its not even the fact that they are obnoxious, annoying or racist. Its the fact that they so willingly blame others, they fail to improve their own gameplay after hours and hours of experience. The people who talk the most are quite literally the worst players. Pro Tip Mute them and tell them you muted them so they begin type less and focus on playing. The idiots spouting the worse nonsense are utter garbage and there are too many. How to spot a raging idiot, preparing themselves for full emotional breakdown. BUY WARDS Idiot who feeds mid. Dies again with two wards... SHOULD HAVE CALLED MISSING WTF Jackass who dove towers and lost a v Insert Racist Comments Raging Idiot Bat Signal v me mid This guys inferiority complex is meme levels SaD yOu dIdNt LEaRn aNytHing fRoM pLaYing Actual idiot, implying you learn from games? wtf lol dude? This is why drugs are for losers. Pro Tip A particularly good way to deal with ragers is when they inevitably feed, just type lol it sparks tremendous reactions between these fumbling jackasses. Sometimes it is better to humble them so they dont make themselves look dumb as hell the next time they decide to say stupid things. Sometimes its better to let them ride it out because they simply cannot help themselves. I found out from my friends they will frequently move onto another subject matter when they realize senpai is not noticing them Pro Tip Have fun, dont let these raging morons ruin the game for you like they did me. If you follow Pro Tips the reactions to the ragers is priceless, it demolishes their spirit and will think twice about their redherring tactics and actually lp and git gud. Extra Had one guy messaging me for several weeks and creating different accounts in order to throw racial slurs. He checked my profile, saw I had a Spanish flag, you can pretty much guess his favorite word. About that beer I owed ya Will destroy your life This is a very good game! All players are very friendly with me and also with my mom I often get asked about what she does and how she is. In this game you will find people all over the world Russia and the rest. People always wait to pick until they can decide a good synergy with their team and then they say one of the following quotes fu.ck you bit.ch Im going mid! I fuc.ked your mother last night I will pick carry even if you did it first FU CANCER OMFG SON OF BIT.CH PIECE OF SH.IT! CANCER TO YOUR FAMILY SUKA I GO MID I PLAY WHAT I WANT I GIVE YOU DIC.K STFU OMFG NOOB REPORT THIS TRASH etc. This game aim for communication and team play so every player go YOLO, die alone and then ask for team and tell on all chat about how stupid they and how he played like a god in almost all the situations the score of this person is Almost forgot very important! Even if you lose or win type gg wp ez. If you lose remember to always say that your team was full of noobs and you could win but not with such bad fu.cktards on your side. Ohhh, also say that enemy team have only noobs in ther composition. This game will teach you how much important is to listen to others and how to play as one. Then you get pretty much screwed cause those are just in theory and in practice all go yolo and fu.ck each other at the most brutal virtual level. Glory to mother Russia! May Putin guide your way! Its a very complex game. Thats not a bad thing. The bad thing is when you play, if you die once or make one mistake, people start criticizing you as if youre in a real battle and their life depends on it. Heres a good example There are lanes, with members on each team. Sometimes you are the only one on your team guarding a certain lane. or people on the other team jump out of nowhere and instantly kill you even when you are playing it safe and right, it just happens. This happens a few times. Your teammates are nowhere to be found. But they are quick to start telling everyone to report you and how bad you suck. So if you decide to back off to where you are letting the other team destroy your towers, because the other team is good at coordinating ninja gang ambushes, then they get mad and say to report you. So now you have a weak character from the other team leveling up and you dying a few times, and realize the other team will destroy me if I go near any of them. So Ill just not do anything and stay away from the action so I dont feed the other team and so I dont have my teammates belittle me. Then guess what happens. Report him me. Why should I want to play a game where everyone tells me Im no good and wants to report me? They just talk all of this crap, and of the time they are losing and dying just as bad as you. And your teammates can see all of your items, so if you buy something they dont want you to buy, or dont buy something they tell you to, they go on a never ending nag fest until you do. So they control the coins I earned...right. Im not anymore, I cant sit down and play this game for hours a day, days a week. So I wont know every single move for the characters, or have the same knowledge as those people that do all the time. I do not enjoy it one bit. I uninstalled this game before for this reason. Didnt play it for half a year. Now I just played it for night and Im sick of it again. Try Paragon. Its a crossplatform rd person v MOBA. Much better experience. You can find a match in less than a minute. Highly recommend that game. If you want strangers to give you a hard time for minutes at a time, tell you to kill yourself, and play this nonstop tattle tale whine fest, then download this game. A game that truly grasps the idea of helping those in dire need to escape their reality. After allowing peru to play on our servers, and bought accounts in k. This game has truly made a better place to find friends of South America, and help people fully understand the hardships and struggles these people go through by having feeding South Americans only play Pos or jungle. It opened up a world of hard working, can collecting children to gather change and be fortunate enough to play at their internet cafes and flood US WestEast. God Bless them. Very thankful for the openmindedness of Valve and their appreciation of Peru Lives Matter. For toxic people by toxic people. I remember when I was dying to download the game in the queue when it came out. Now I just feel bad thinking about all the time and money I spent playing this game. feelsbadman horrible experience and teammates yet I keep getting back into the game once in a week taught me many languages always mid or feed always shout at your teammates if they arent doing a good job. this game changed my life, i dont know if its for the positive or negative yet The game teaches you how to destroy your life in less than a week. This game ruined my life. Cannot recommend highly enough. dont play this game This game will absorb your soul. Stay away The community is more toxic than a nuclear waste. I speak Fillipino fluently after weeks of playing it. This game makes me want to kill myself CAN WE PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT THROW GAMES? LIKE MAYBE BAN THEM FROM RANKED FOR DAYS THEN MAYBE DAYS THEN MAYBE WEEKS THEN MAYBE A MONTH THEN MAYBE A YEAR THEN MAYBE YEARS THEN MAYBE FOR LIFE. thanks icefrog bae Another thought maybe give extra MMR FOR SUPPORT PLAYERS SO PEOPLE ACTUALLY TRY. New patch same system. I actually get reported by the people running down middle feeding at minute one. Good job valve uninstalling. I actually dont have enough ing reports to use on people throwing in my games, good system would recommend to others. I have played Dota for a little over three years now, so I think I am finally ready to give it an in depth review. I gave this game a review back in but I am going to change that. First of all, Im going to start by listing off what I like about the game. THE PROS Dota is, obviously, a team game. Playing this game with friends is a really fun experience and can act as a source of really fantastic memories. My point is, if you play this game with a group of four other friends, Dota is probably one of the best options out there. Dota has a fantastic tutorial system and the game is very well designed to accomodate new players. A new player can go from a full AI game to an AI game with other random people to playing a v online the transition is really smooth. I have played both League and Dota, and I can honestly say that I think that Dota is much more visually pleasing to look at. A smooth, clean UI makes the game easier on the eyes compared to Leagues cartoony design which suits some, but not me. Dota has an extremely vast pool of heroes that can be played to suit almost anyones playstyle. After you play Dota for awhile, you can pick out the heroes that really fit your playstyle and excel at them through ranked matchmaking. Its damn near impossible to be bad at literally every hero. The large hero pool allows for THOUSANDS of different lineup possibilities, meaning every game has the chance to be completely new and different than anything youve played before. Honestly, Dota is one of the most addicting games I have ever played. No it is THE most addicting game I have ever played. As a fulltime student, I still have managed to rack up hours in this game in my freetime. Especially back when I was a new player, I played this game all the time. However. I am actually changing my review of this game from positive to negative. Let me tell you why. THE CONS Heres my biggest flaw with the game. I absolutely hate I MEAN HATE Valves regional matchmaking. Before finding a match, the player is supposed to change server preferences to the closest servers to the members of the party, and they are supposed to choose the appropriate language preference. For example, as an American player, it is expected that you choose U.S. West and U.S. East as your servers, with English as your language preference. And, generally, Americans follow this rule. HOWEVER. In almost every game I play now, I get a Peruvian or Brazilian or someone from South East Asia in my games. Hopefully it makes sense to the readers of this review that you should not be finding a match in the United States if you live in Asia. You lag, and become actually useless in the game. The South Americans, though, spam in their native languages and constantly flame. Am I generalizing? Honestly, no. Im really not. If you are good at Dota you would and should queue for games for which you are prepared to play at your best. Valve has no form of region lock on matchmaking they really cant, due to international professional teams, and while its really not Valves fault, I just wish there was some way to reliably play with four people from your country andor language. This is seriously Dota s biggest flaw, because so much of every game revolves around the synergy and cooperation among teammates. This is literally impossible when someone spends the entire game flaming you in a different language. Im honestly not trying to be discriminatory in any way this is just how Dota is in reality and is likely never to change. I have become so fed up with this poor form of matchmaking that I have actually, finally, uninstalled the game. Dota has actually no reliable way to punish feeders. Sure, you and your team can use the report system you only have a limited number of reports by the way, so after you expend them on flamers or feeders you are out of luck and have to enlist the other team and your teammates to waste their reports on the other feeders and flamers. The feeder may get put in low priority, but it honestly teaches them nothing. We have all been in low prio at one point or another, and we come out unchanged. Valve needs to implement a way to correct this. Im not alone in my view on this either. Even professional player Secret.Puppey voiced his opinion the other day, which is very similar to mine. Punishments need to become more severe. The Dota community is actually cancerous. If you are not playing in a stack of friends, I can almost promise you that you will very rarely, if ever, get on a team where all teammates are willing to cooperate and play as a coordinated team. Almost every single game, someone on your team will flame someone else for sucking really bad, mostly because they probably did. But people speak so hatefully towards one another that it really feels like an unwelcoming scene. One of the professional Dota casters joinDotas Capitalist tweeted the other day that he loses so much respect for pro players in pubs because they spend so much time flaming and tilting. This is actually about of the Dota community, actually, not just the professionals. Everyone has this weird god complex where they are convinced they are better than everyone on the server, even if they got no kills and fed unimaginably badly. This kind of ties in with the points I have made previously. It is almost impossible to singlehandedly win a game if your team is playing very poorly. Thus, the entire game comes down to teamwork and most Dota players are unreliable teammates who will either feed or flame roughly, like I said. The of people who dont flame are the people who are actually in professional teams and while they flame in pubs, they synergize well in their professional settings unless you are kuro and rtz. Dota is really bad for your health unless you have a godly amount of self control. If you win a game, you can end happy. But if you lose a game, you keep playing and keep losing and it becomes very depressing and frustrating. The garbage community gets in your head, and its just bad. Look, honestly, I fully expect to continue to follow the professional Dota scene. Dota really is one of the best games out there and its especially fun to watch the pros play. But, if you are looking for a MOBA that you can regularly enjoy, then you are better off playing StarCraft II, which is where I am headed now. Dont get me wrong, though Dota is still much better than League of Legends and I would never suggest League of Legends to anyone unless they are really, really struggling with Dota I wont be returning to Dota until Valve makes some much needed changes to the game, or at least until I have had a long, muchneeded break from the seriously draining community that Dota offers. TLDR Its a good MOBA, better than LoL, but too many community matchmaking issues to make this worth a positive. Gave me a great years of entertainment though. Play SCII. Rating Good game, for awhile. But community is horrible. My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about years old when my mother said to him, If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediatelly. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me Dont ever smoke. Please dont put your family through what your Grandfather put us through. I agreed. At I have never touched a cigarete. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway. To those who hasnt played dota and willing to start playing Youll always be wrong. Youll always be blamed. Youll be always noted as a stealer after killing. Youll get reported for no reason. Youll be thought naturaly how to insult in Russian, Tagalog, and other languages you have never heard before. Roles that are actualy exist All Carry. Youll be forced to hate others without knowing the reason. Best way to improve your goodsport behave is by stop playing any games. Youll regard this game slightly higher than your school. On stage MMR, the objective would be Buy A Microphone. Youll get higher scores in English subject. Your ego will be boasted. Mental illness. Prove? check all reviews of Dota. Negative writings for a thumbs up. In the end, youll find yourself regretting pn why have you decided to play this game. Best MOBA game PERIOD Lol better than lol ... lol. Still cant find my friends... Once you start playing, you will realized that this game gives you cancer and why people still play it. You learn how to learn, how to lose and most importantly you learn about you. Alright.... so here is my dota review after playing almost hours over the span of years. general thoughts and how i started I was when a friend recommended dota to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that saying nothing is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional s. Did i waste my youth? So this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but careerschoolwise i highly doubt that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts lets learn music or lets study wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of improving wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that. time invested into dota EVERY dota player that has spent more than hours into this game has had that thought of oh man i shouldve learned something with this time.... i couldve been amazing now.. at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota is that spending s of hours is something you do with pleasure. Its kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for school again i realized how much ing time hours is. I garantue you that you will be a top student if youd put hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING. REWARDING dota is IGN REWARDING. you learn a new hero BAMM MMR. you start understanding how to farm M M R YOUR RANK GOES IGN UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this yeargrades are OKkinda good, not great. ReasoN I WROTE THIS im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY ed up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do CONCLUSION AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUNif you are competetive Source will fix the game they said, but what they dont know is that you cant fix what was already perfect. Neverforgetsource This game is like injecting a rusty needle of heroin directly into your eyeballs it hurts so bad but you just cant stop Ruined my life once. Never go back to this sht. First there was DotA, The WC III Version. Then LoL was released few years later with a bit better graphics. People said LoL is the best moba now and it erased the WC III version of DotA. Then DotA was released, and defeated LoL, But LoL and DotA are still fighting to prove whos the best. Yet still nobody plays HoN. Sometimes your own life becomes boring or some difficulties make your life unbearable. In these times, in order to move away from my life, i play some games especially this game. it takes my mins. fairly convenient time. When i start this game it feels like im diving into some other universe. I figure out that i control some other things out of my organs. Then i feel this game in last points of my veins. After end of the game, i feel happy and relax no matter win or lose. I think i am addicted to this game. Wish i knew how to refund my life help Dota is one of the most spectacular MOBA games ever. It went through a lot of changes and updates. When I start playing Defence of the Ancient it wasnt that much donation and sets. But what we see now? The amount of sets is too damn high, the creators just makin money, you cant even define the character by some of its stuff. Also, sin not to mention the community. It is smth terrible and disgusting, I played only games out of without trash talking about me and my relatives. Just think about it, is it normal? Dota literally is like narcotic, you should pass a long way to stop playing it. I wasted ,. hours in the shuffle. It is the biggest regret in my life till now. Take thought, does this stupid game worth your own time, money and nerves? I dont think so and thats why I dont recommend this game to any of YOU! Reccomended for all sadomasochists Who is playing this in I wont be able to get Divine even if I was in infinite Tsukuyomi... Dota is less of a game, more of a tool of self discovery. In fact, thinking of dota as a game at all is a mistake games are designed to be enjoyable and fun. Enjoying yourself and having fun is the the lowest priority for those who play dota, especially for those in low priority. they prefer instead to stubbornly not enjoy themselves while simultaneously making sure nobody else is having any fun either. Every facet of the game has been finely tuned to reflect the players personality to the point that each decision they make in game is synonymous with how russian they are they conduct themselves in their day to day lives, what kind of attributes they hold in high esteem and strive to emulate in pursuit of bettering themselves becoming the transcendent doto master they know theyre destined to be. Although it seems at first to be a team game of v, this is a very shallow perspective which will correct itself after around fifteen minutes of your first game. Same goes for the goal of destroying the other teams towers, barracks and ancient. These objectives are simply filler while you forcibly and decisively assert your rightful dominance over your team via your mic or hastily written yet crushingly witty remarks in the chat. dont worry about the other team, theyre fighting amongst themselves and dont matter anyway remember youre better than your teammates and its inconceivable that theres any possibility you did or will ever do anything wrong, regardless of what may be transpiring before your very eyes. The interface and minimap should be largely ignored in favour of committing your attention wholly to the chat box, here you can see the current state of the game clearer than anywhere else, it may take a while to understand some of the games many colloquialisms such as and no courier gg my team are ff, but dont worry if you cant understand, its not so much about comprehension as asserting your right to say things that dont need to be said and are generally trivial and unhelpful. If you find yourself doing poorly and being shouted at by your team for feeding, dont fret. They are likely jealous of your superior skills and cant understand that are actually the ones letting down. Just remind yourself of that one game you had that went freakishly well and make fun of someones build. worst game ever. Ive played Dota SMITE, League of Legends and Dota but Dota community is by far the worse Ive seen. Ended up crying on the inside everytime i have become one with the feeding I have been playing DOTA for a long time now and have been following the pro scene watching tournaments left and right whenever they are broadcasted, know the teamsplayers to the point I understand every meme there is about them and absolutely love that part of this game. But this review is going to talk about my personal negative experience as a player whose played the matchmaking and the community that you will experience and to warn new players of what they may experience themselves if they decide to try this game. So after pouring a huge chunk of my life into this game, I have decided to finally quit and move on with my life. I have neglected real life responsiblities because of this game spending time with my wife and kid. I have also wasted time on this game that I could have spent playing many, many other games that are in my steam library that have basically rotted for the past years. Almost every match I have played left me with some sort of rage inside or anger that I couldnt let go of until I started another match and sometimes that match that follows would continue until I have a winning match. To be honest though the rage and anger definintely outweighs the happiness and slight adrenaline rush from winning a match. I would not recommend this game to someone new who is wanting to start into MOBAS or even looking to start a new game. It has sucked many hours from my life that I farily regret spending, as well as money that I spent on cosmeticskins. This money and time could have been spent on family matters or bills, something that is more important than a game. Although money isnt neccesarry to play the game to the fullest, it is just something that will taunt you when playing seeing the shiny skins for heroes on your homepage and sales for items can be alitte tempting at times. Something else that you see people mentioning in reviews is that the community is absolutely toxic, which is entirely true. Almost every match you will run into rage filled people that will say anything and everything to make you feel terrible about your self which in turn makes you play worse, even if you arent neccesarily playing that bad. I will say though the games mechanics and design is very well done and is very enjoyable for the most part, just everything else mentioned in my review kind of outweighs it. I want to say goodbye to DOTA once and for all. Finally I can continue on with my life as a normal person. Dota is like your wife. Youll always cherish the good times and love her no matter what, but sometimes you guys argue and she just gets under your skin and makes you super frustrated. Itll be fine by tomorrow as always.Love ya, babe. whos the guy with the axe? By playing DotA you are signing a contract. The contract states that you will forfeit your life and nationality, becoming a soulless russian who plays this game nonstop. Hours of fun, all you have to do is select in which Russia you want to play today! A very beginner friendly, userfriendly videogame with deep, insightful characters that have amazing character development, which will lead you to tears in some cases. Like the poor blind guy who finally achieved greatness because his mom said he could It also has a very friendly community that is very helpful to beginners. I recommend this game to any and all casual gamers, especially fans of light, friendly games and their community, like Club Penguin and ch. an. Also, characters in this game are very easy to learn and their abilities are easy to utilize, allowing easy collaboration with teammates and friends, for example Meepo the Geomancer is a great character for those new to the game, and I recommend all new players choose him. Theres minor drawbacks in useful content though, like certain things are outright useless like Couriers and Support characters and they should be removed from the game to make it perfect and this is coming from a long term investor of this game who has dedicated many hours to be exact to this extremely fun indie game. All in all, if youve never played a videogame in your life or have never spent time on the internet, Dota is right for you! According to the U.S. Foreign Service Institute, it takes approximately hours to acquire advanced proficiency in Japanese language. It would take approximately hours of studying to finish university and receive a major. According to The National Jurist, it takes about to hours to prepare for the bar exam passing which makes you a lawyer. It requires near hours to read Leo Tolstoys War and Peace and Anna Karenina both. The Department of Health and Human Services of the USA recommends an average adult to do roughly hours of sports a year to stay healthy... You get the point. Dont even frakking think of playing this. i had a life before i played dota, it ruined my college life after i played dota, i lost my girlfriend bcoz of dota, i gained weight bcoz of dota, i lost my job bcoz of dota, now i am selling my stuff on market bcoz i know i play dota, i want to leave dota but i cant escape playing dota, hours on my account and i still want to play dota, my beard is big as hell bcoz i play dota, i want to quit,but i cant quit dota, its all true, bcoz it ruined my life bcoz i play dota, Its and i still want to play dota, But i have to stop it now but i still i want to play dota, I have health problems bcoz of dota,but still i want to play dota, This is not life but still i want to play dota, I cant have sex bcoz i am fat but still i want to play dota, I tried to be Hindi Caster for India and it Lusts me to play dota, But its High Time and I Have to Quit Dota, I am Finally Deleting this game without backup but my heart still wants dota!! Last But Not Least SO IF U WANT A LIFE,JUST STOP PLAYING DOTA!! Better than League Of Legends because it has Sniper and Techies would mining again I couldve become fluent in another language. The only game where one win equals to two losses. I rate Made my family think i got some kind of mental illness.... After dollars, hours, some boyfriends, and some keyboards Ill tell you something. Run, run and dont install this. would give my soul again. If u want to learn Russian, play Dota. goodbye doto tnx u saved my social life I do not like this game at all. Its a terrible game. Please stop playing this game. Please send help. This game remembered my birthday when everyone else forgot. Que simulator is a gr game. I was able to get a combo of over minutes the other day. Would totally recommend for all hardcore gamers. Patches gave me cancer Worst coop game ever. You play support? Your carries feed. You play carry? You dont have any support. You play gankerinitiatior? Your whole team ignores you. Wanna get your blood boiling? This is the game for you. And the MMR sucks. Honest opinion? well... Dont expect propper language m, n dont get triggered easily DOTA Contains RETARDNESS, CANCER, TOXICITY, PAIN, SORROW, AGONY, MOTIVATION, HAPPYNESS, JOYBRINGER, MOODBOOSTER at the same time its toxic af, but yah its multiplayer battleground so what did you expect?? even roblox server can be more cancer aswell. bring some friends on earlier game playtime or just having fun may be great ATTENTION ONCE U CAME IN, U NEVER EVER CAME OUT dunno maybe its my personal experience but whenever u go, bought other game and play it, time by time, doto is calling me out, shes crawling into my soul, my brain and spoke LOVE MEE!!! PROOOS isnt pay to win, but the skin also tempting and ma lord gabe is de best thief off all time Pretty decent graphic, somehow the atmosphere is soothing Amazing dev sooo spry bout bug n errors in game mechanic Marvelous community beside the toxic one Never ending possibility Theres always sometin new in dota, when u feel bored, smh dev will put sometin different Excellently fun to play with a bunch of friends strength in numbers apply To mocking ppl or roasting somebody XD Many great and inspirational stories from the pro player or wannabes Getting better day by day with patch and other fix Boredom reliever A lotta things u can do in dota, watch pro player replays, stream match, different game modes in arcade section, even only to idling in lobby Smh can improve ur ability to work together, to communicate, to be a decent human being Expose the diversity of human nature Train u to not giving up, coz cumback is real m!!! better than ..... add it by yourself, try it. COOONS dank it man, idk what to say anymore, every fokin time dis game make me angry, sad, depress, but it also fill my life up, dis game is blessed and cursed. Tooooxic of course if u were new on this scene, especially moba game, bring some friend if u cant bear the burden of life Theres no such things like peeenoise or indog or anything like dat, theres only bad people Fokin smurf, Still smell a bit of racism doto is cancer center XD Sooo many butthurt ppl, salt, edgyness, n many moar ..... add it by yourself, try it. i cant describe more bout it bcause, whenever i hate dis game, i will always comeback hangin with it OOOVERALLL PLAY IT FFS !!!!!!!! as big smoke said Same things make us laugh, make us cry. would praise lord gabe for skins IGN My Grandfather smoked hes whole life. I was about years old when my mother said to him If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.. Tears welled up in hes eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me My mother said to me Dont ever smoke. Please dont put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.I agreed. At I started smokin because this game already gave me cancer anyway. Totaly recommend for smokers This is one of the best games Ive ever played, and Ive never felt more empty sinking hours into it. The reward for a thoughtful draft, perfect game play, team work, and victories is an incredible feeling...but the amount of you have to put up with to get there is so insanely disgusting its not worth it anymore. The DOTA community is as much a community as a pile of flesh eating bacteria. Occasionally you meet someone nice who wants to win DOTA, but nearly every game there are raging piles of useless human flesh whose only sole purpose in life is to make you as miserable as possible, and their conduit of choice? DOTA. I put more hours than I could imagine into this game in hopes it could only get better, sometimes I would go an entire week really enjoying the game. I was repaid with months full of seething frustration. TLDR Game is awesome, people you have to play with are not. GLHF somewhere else. You ever wanted to instantly become racist? Cuz I didnt but its a bit late now. An uncontrollable rage towards minorities Worst community ever, consisting inadequate animals and kids. You either quit while you are the feeder or play long enough to see yourself become toxic. If Dota was my job, Id have worked for almost years, playing hours every workday, before quitting. And it took me that long to realise that it actually sucks. Designed to make you hate life and everyone else. This game and others like it are a psychological hell and youd do your health and your ambitions a favour if you uninstalled this as quickly as possible. Youre better off playing with your testicles. At this point in time, Ive wasted round years of my life playing this game. Its a small amount compared to the hours that my peers and teammates have amassed, even I, who had started when beta was released to the general public. A good chunk of the gaming population has played it at least once, or have heard of it, or am still playing even as type this review out. Anywho, lets talk about Dota. Dota is not a game its a major time sink. You spend the first games improving your gameplay to be even called below average, whilst losing horribly in every single one. You will weep. Burst in an outrage. Asking yourself why did you ever choose to play this game in the first place. Every single game roughly consists of mins that you give all your efforts to be returned with a fleeting feeling of joy. Bliss. Or the soul crushing depression of losing the past games during the weekend the times you turned down your friends at a night out to play this game. Its not because Dota is hard. No, no. Its not the mechanics that you have finetuned yourself in being able to do over and over a times without messing up. In my words, it could very well be as easy as playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure or as ball crushing hard as playing Dark Souls with no proper equipment simply because the game boils down to one thing Teamwork. Synergy between people, how they cooperate, willingly or not. More often at times youre going to have the most disillusioned people with a lexicon of a drunk jaded middleaged man whos going through a mid life crisis rather than the quiet, reserved player who tries hisher best in assisting your efforts in a win. It can be argued that the game can be won singlehandedly by a skilled player, but its a pipe dream to seek that out, for most of the general population but it does not deter them from doing so, which leads to yet another problemfrustration within the game. People seek glory within it they yearn the temporary recognition it brings, and those players put their teammates beneath them, which ultimately loses them the game. In short there are a lot of different reasons and expectations of the game, which may cause conflicts ultimately losing you the game. Save yourself the trouble and do something else. Edit For those of you who cant math for some reason, k hours over years is roughly games a day assuming its a game is an hour on average. A very confusing game, that strives to continue where Heroes of Legends left off, but resorts a bit too often to slavic jumpscares to create an immersive Slendermanlike experience. Current main issues Pros A friendly and positive community Possibility to make friends and discuss delicate topics with new people from various ethnic backgrounds, chat comes with emoticons and other essential stuff Strong focus for learning new languages Full of fun minigames if the main game is not compelling, like the Shopkeepers quiz, buying stuff from the Valve shop, ingame advertisement clicking, guessgames for DOTA network offline times etc Cons I picked the Sniper class but had trouble aiming in the first person mode, needs to be fixed asap Playing the game with Oculus Rift resulted in nausea Low replayability, after their first game everone I know has practically reached their skill cap Basic things like ingame quicksave and quickload functionality is missing Raid bosses like Roshan and Troll Warlord are hard to understand and severely imbalanced Steam achievements were teased but are still not working, I already ate my th tree but didnt get the achievement The crafting system is confusing and unintuitive Want to create a drum? Well, you need a robe and a bracer, of course! Want to create a buckler? Yep, you guessed it, you need a chainmail shirt armor and a branch! Hitboxes are off and often clipping for example, I bought a bigger sword for the Sven class, but game doesnt register hits that clearly happen against smaller models like the Phantom Assassin NPCs like the mud golem and the shopkeeper only have few lazy dialogue lines, I was more interested in hearing their immersive part of the story while constructing a hut in a nearby forest out of treebranches RTS system for building or repairing base components are limited to only a few heroes and could use a revamp Character wipes happen a bit too often in the servers Ive been at Without going into too many spoilers, finishing the campaign left me with more questions than satisfying answers. For example, why was the evil Dragon Knight so eager to hurt the seemingly innocent creeps for monetary gain? Why did the mysterious Drow Ranger attack our valiant hero? Why does Axe look like a tomato? So many questions, yet so few answers. Overall, the game is OK for an early access FPSRPG hybrid but doesnt entertain the more hardcore gamers for very long. For a smalltime indie developer team I guess its acceptable, but Id wait for more available DLC expansions before paying anything for the main game. Start a game of my team mates abandon of my enemies abandon on of them says You know, we will win. me... challenge accepted buy rapiers get rampages win would v again Game was great. ruined it. If Dota was my job, Id have worked for almost years, playing hours every workday, before quitting. And it took me that long to realise that it actually sucks. Learn any language spoken in South America in less than a month, guaranteed! Better than Rosetta Stone Fastest way to learn russian, Dota Russians Dota RageSalty Dota An intense feeling of murder for teammates Dota Life wasted but still plays it anyway Dota Riki rage Dota would waste my life again Heroes are Free played it a bit. learnt colorful words from several languages. would trashtalk again If u want to waste ur lifetime and benefit form a totally toxic community, then this is the right game for you. Imagine pouring hot wax all over your chest while having two asian transvestites from Puerto Rico wearing tracksuits massaging your back with mayonnaise, and include Bochka, Bass and Kolbaser banging your eardrums and youll get DotA Never ever even consider downloading this bs of a game. Ive wasted like .k hrs like only getting an understanding of what is happening and what consecutive inputs should i perform not to be yelled at. And after some time, when ive figured out what to do, i still get yelled at, cuz my teammates are in almost every game either toxic pieces of or just with single digit iq. Every game you try your best, you do a lot better then your teammates do, but these boys just decide to stay afk cuz why tf not. Just believe me and never install this thing. This game is pure evil, genuine source of frustration, which gave terrible headache to anyone whod ever tried Dota. If you like to lose your like to scream at the screen and argue with ppl youll never ever see in your life its your choice. I played for a bit. Its fun. I learned to hate people Ive never met. Hard to get into, and elves and fire rock men and magic axes arent my thing. But theres something about it I cant stop playing. You can eat a tree to gain health. Its basically the best thing ever. The Only MOBA that Matters Old friends have been silenced, or fallen by the wayside. I no longer know or recognize most members of the research team, though I believe the spirit of rebellion still persists. I expect you know better than I the appropriate course of action, and I leave you to it. Except no further correspondence from me regarding these matters this is my final epistle. I wanna be a proplayer so ing bad Buy all of the games I never had I wanna be on the cover of Dota Magazine Smiling next to Sing and Kuroky But everytime I close my eyes I see Bloodseeker in his tights, uhuu yeheehe A different hero every night, alright, I swear, there goes my MMR When Ill be a proplayer...

My mother said to me Dont ever smoke. Please dont put your family through what your Grandfather put us through. I agreed. At I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway. Have played game for hours and still have not found a single way to reach the ending. for gameplay. for direction. Worst UI ever ., skill, stat buff effect,item everything so small and unclear. Do the team trying to pull other MOBA players by changing the UI? Congratulation man you made it. this game is bad for ur life Better than Bubble You can learn fluent Russain in games how many russians can fit into a single game is the real question here Socially dangerous tool to destroy and sap the life out of friendship.
