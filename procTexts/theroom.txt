This play can be played without any age restriction. It will work if the chemistry between all the characters makes sense. Human behavior and betrayal applies to all of us. It exists within ourselves. You love somebody. Do you? What is love? You think you have everything, but you dont have anything. You have to have hope and spirit. Be an optimist. But can you handle all your human behavior or others behavior? You dont want to be good, but great. I am not a slave here, am I? Did you like last night? Yes, I did. What time do you have to be there? Where is my coffee? What time do you have to be there? I told you many times! I have my promotion to think about Promotion! Promotion! Thats all I hear about. Here is your coffee and English muffin and burn your mouth. Old man Donkey lets me know today. I have to think about our future Well at least I dont have a promotion to think about. You have too much competition in the computer field. I can handle it. You worry about yourself. You sound like we have separate lives. We will be married next month Lisa. Yeah .... Yeah .... Well Thank you for breakfast. See you later. Hi mom. How are you doing? Im fine. Whats happening with you? Nothing much. Whats wrong? Tell me. Im not feeling good today. Why not? I dont think I want to get married. Why not? I dont love him anymore. Why not? Tell me why. Hes boring. Well youve known him for over five years. Youre engaged! You said you loved him. You should reconsider. He supports you, he provides for you, and you cant support yourself. He is a good guy and he loves you very much. His income is very secure and he told me he wants to buy you a home. Thats why hes boring. What are you going to do? Urn, I dont know. I dont mind living with him. You cant do that. Did you tell Johnny about it? No I don t know what to do Hes a very nice person and you know he s getting a promotion soon. He bought you a car, a ring, clothes, whatever you like and now you want to dump him. Its not right. Ive always thought of him as my son in law. You should marry him. He would be good for you. Oh, I guess youre right about that, mom. Of course Im right my dear, I know about men. I was not born yesterday. Im glad you listen to your mother. Nobody else listens to me I work so hard and nobody appreciates it. I try to tell them what they should do, but they dont listen. I guess Ill try. See you later, mom. Okay. Take care of yourself, Lisa. Bye. Bye mom. Hello? Hey baby, how are you doing? Oh hi, Im very busy. How are you doing? I just finished talking to my mother and she just finished giving me this big lecture about how big and great Johnny is. Well talk about it later. As I already told you Im very busy. Busy doing what? Well talk about it now. Whenever you say well talk about it later, we never do. I cant wait till later, we have to talk right now. You owe me one anyway. Remember when Johnny saved your life? Remember it was all because of me telling him to do it? Okay you win. What do you want to talk about? She is a stupid, fucking bitch. She wants to control my life. I will not put up with that anymore. Shes not the boss of me, and nobodys going to tell ME what to do Im going to do whatever I want and thats it! What do you think I should do? I need your advice. Why do you ask me? I mean youve been very happy with Johnny. What do you want me to say? You should enjoy life. Whats the problem? Maybe youre right. Can I see you for coffee tomorrow? Ok, about twelve noon? Okay. I will be waiting baby. Bye Bye Who is it? Billy. Hey Billy, how are you doing? Im fine. Whats new? Actually, Im really busy. Do you want something? No thanks. I just want to see Johnny. You look....um, beautiful, today.... so, yeah can I kiss Johnny? You are such a little brat! Im just kidding! I love you and Johnny, but especially Johnny Everybody loves Johnny.... Oh, ok, Johnny is going to be here any minute. You can wait if you want. I got to go. Youll tell him I stopped by? Of course I will. Bye Bye Billy. Hi babe, these are for you. Oh thanks, they are beautiful. Did you get your promotion, honey? You didnt get it did you. That son of a bitch told me I will get within three months. Its not right. I save them bundles, they are crazy. I dont think I will ever get it. They trick me, they didnt keep their promise, they betray me, and I dont care anymore. Did you tell them how much you saved them? Of course I did. What do you think? They already put my ideas into practice. Already the bank saves tons of money. They should be grateful to have someone like me who is so good at doing the things I do there. Instead old man Donkey is using me and Im the fool. I still love you. Youre the only one who does. You still have friends, I didnt get any calls today. Youre right, this computer business is too competitive. I called a dozen of my old clients and they dont need me. Do you want me to order a pizza or something? Whatever I dont care. What kind of topping do you want? I dont care. Are you alright? What is the matter? Its just a lousy promotion Ill fix a cup of chocolate. That will make you feel better. Thank you. I need a drink. I dont drink, you know. Its good for you. Dont worry about it. I cant drink that. You must be crazy. If you love me, you will drink this, my darling. You are not drinking your cognac, dear. It will taste good with the pizza. Youre right, its good. I know, I am right. Dont worry about those fuckers. You are a good man. Lets drink and have some fun. You have nice legs. You have nice pecs.

What are you talking about? Sorry my darling. I just wanted to hear your sexy voice. I can tell you something now. I like how you put our sexy hands around my body. You excite me so, and I love you. Is Johnny there? Yeah hes in the shower, but I like you better. But I dont understand you. Why do you do that? Because I love you. You dont care, do you. Yes I do care, but we agreed that its over between us. I understand. Im with you, its our secret. I still have feelings for you, but I guess you dont care. Yes, I do care. Dont drive yourself crazy. I have to go now. See you later my darling. Dont call me that. Okay bye. Bye Who were you talking to? My mother Is she okay? Oh, she tested for breast cancer, now shes talking about dying. Its no big deal these days, is it? No, Im not worried. Dinner is ready. What happened last night? I dont remember anything. Did we make love? You dont remember? You poor little thing. You dont remember when you hit me? Hit you! I never would do that, even if I was drunk! You must be kidding. Its not true, is it? Do you have a bruise? Yes, its true. I will never drink again. I feel sick. I cant eat any more. Im strong. Dont worry about it. I need some money. I have to buy a new dress. How much do you want? Around Oh wow. Why so much? Thank you Johnny. Youre always so generous with me. I have to be. Youre my future wife. We will be married soon. You love me, dont you? Of course I do. Im going to the roof to straighten out my head. Why, is it crooked? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. But are you okay? Im fine. Dont worry about it. I did not hit her. Its not true! Its bullshit, I did not hit her. Why did Lisa say that? I would never do that! I did not hit her! Oh hi Mark. Whats up with you? Not much. Im just sitting up here thinking about life. I wonder if girls like to cheat like guys do? What makes you say that? Well, Im just thinking, you know. I dont have to worry about that because Lisa is loyal to me. You never know. People are very strange this days. I used to know a girl who had a dozen guys. One of them found out about it, beat her up and she ended up in a hospital. What a story! You can say that again. Im so lucky I have you as my best friend and I love Lisa so much Yeah man, you are lucky. Very .... lucky You should have a girl Mark. Yeah, I guess youre right. Maybe I have one already. I dont know yet. Well what happened to that girl? Remember? Betty? Thats her name, isnt it? Betty? Yeah Yeah, we dont see each other anymore. Besides she wasnt any good in bed. She was beautiful, but we had too many arguments Thats too bad. My Lisa is great when I can get it. I just cant figure women out. Sometimes theyre smart, sometimes theyre dumb. Sometimes theyre good, sometimes theyre bad. Sometimes theyre nice, sometimes theyre not nice. They are evil, seductive and hostile. Seems to me like youre an expert on this. Nooooo Im definitely not an expert. Whats bothering you Mark? Nothing man! Forget it! Is it some secrets Mark? Why dont you tell me? We are like brothers, we shouldnt have secrets. No forget it. Ill talk to you later! So, Im organizing a party for Johnnys birthday. Can you come? When is it? Next Friday at six. Its a surprise. You can bring someone if you want. Well, sure, I can come, but I dont know if Ill bring anybody. Oh that jerk Harold, he wants me to give him a share of my house. That house belongs to me, he has no right. Im not giving him a penny. Who does he think he is? Hes your brother. He is always bugging me about my house. Fifteen years ago we agreed that house belongs to me. Now the value of the house is going up and hes seeing dollar signs. Everything goes wrong at once. Nobody wants to help me and Im dying. We already discussed this. Youre not dying mom. I am Lisa. I finally got the results of the test back. I definitely have breast cancer. Look, dont worry about it, everything will be fine. They are curing lots of people everyday and Johnny says its not a big deal anymore Im sure hes right. Ill be fine. Oh I heard Edward is talking about me. He is a hateful man. Im so glad I divorced him. I really think he gave me the breast cancer after he slept with that hooker. That type of riffraff carry all sorts of things. Dont you agree? Look, dont worry about it. You just concentrate on getting well Well at least you have a good man. Youre wrong, mom. Hes not what you think he is. He didnt get his promotion, and he got drunk last night and he hit me. Johhny doesnt drink. What are you talking about? He did last night, and I dont love him anymore. Johnny is your financial security. You cant afford to ignore this Yeah, ok mom. Can I just talk to you later? You dont want to talk to me. I just got done talking with a client and I have to get ready to meet him. Can I just talk to you later? Ok, I will see you later. Bye, bye. How much time do we have? I dont know. A couple of hours at least. Lets have some fun. Did you know that chocolate is the symbol of love? Feed me Yum. Its delicious, just like your neck. Arm s up Chocolate is the symbol of love. Hello .... What are these characters doing here? They like to come here to do their homework. What homework! Its in Michelles purse. Mom, this is Michelles boyfriend Bran. Bran, this is my mother Its a pleasure to meet you. Uh, huh. All that shopping wore me out. Hey Lisa. He spots Claudette. Oh, hello ... .mother What a pleasant surprise to see you here Well, well. If it isnt my son, the homo. I just need to borrow some sugar. Help yourself Billy. I also need a cup of flour and half a stick of butter. Just what sort of perverted filth are you planning to use those ingredients for!? Ill come back later. Tell me, what does Billy do for money? Youre not lending him any I hope Johnny wanted to adopt Billy after you disowned him. Its really a tragedy how many kids out there dont have a great friend like Johnny. When Billy turned eighteen, Johnny found him a little apartment here in this building and he is paying for it until he graduates from school. Johnny is very caring about the people in his life, and he gave Billy his own set of keys to our place. Billy has a thing for Johnny, but I dont like it, so we try to discourage it. That boy has been nothing but trouble. First the cesarean and now this. Its time Billy grew up and took care of himself. Johnny really cares about Billy, but Billy is so annoying. Thats another reason why I dont love Johnny anymore. Johnny makes a lot of money, so please dont hurt him. Now If you really dont love Johnny so be it, but you should wait till after youre married before you tell him. That way he has to split his assets with you if he wants a divorce. I forgot my book. Some book! Whats it called, The Week Bran Forgot To Change His Underwear? Oh, thats nothing. Homework? Dont worry about it. If I were a burglar, you would be my best friend. Look, I dont want to talk about it. You know, I worry about you. I have to go home. Dont you ever have sex with that Bran character. Homework indeed. Ok mom Bye, bye. I need a drink. Hey Billy. Jimmy! Ive been looking for you. Yeah, sure you have. You have my money right. Yeah its coming. Itll be here in a few minutes. What do you mean its coming Billy? Wheres my money? Okay, chill out there Gramaha, Supreme Leader of the Astra Galactic Command. Just hold your wiener for five minutes and relax. The cash is on its way. Five minutes? You want five fucking minutes. You know what... I havent got five fucking minutes! Im going to ask you only one more time, so you better answer right. Wheres my money Billy? Bite me! Wheres my money Billy? Wheres my fucking money Billy? What did you do with my fucking money, you homo? Its coming! Its coming! Wheres my fucking money Billy? Put the gun down! Whats the matter Billy, do guns scare you? Guns dont scare me. Idiots with guns scare me. Thats it! Wheres my fucking money Billy!? Over there! All of you, over there! NOW! Say your prayers wienerheads, because Im about to make some Swiss cheese out of YOU! Do you know who I am? I have black belts, Masters degrees and a PhD in Agricultural Economics. Thats right, you know Im way better than you, and all my friends will gladly tell you just how great and awesome I am! Have you seen my power level? Its over ,! You know what that means? It means I have more than units of POWER. It also puts my total adjusted force rating at ,! Thats more than triple, so you dont want to make me mad, because anger is my middle name! Dont touch Jimmy!!! Billy.... are you okay? What did that man want from you? Nothing That was not nothing! Tell me everything! You have no idea what kind of trouble you are in here, do you I owe him some money. What kind of money? I owe him some money. What kind of money? Everything is okay, hes gone! Everything is not okay. That is a dangerous man. Calm down. Johnnys taking him to jail! Billy, what kind of money? Just tell me! What do you need money for? Mom please! Billy is with me and Johnny! A man like that with a gun! Oh my god! Billy, look at me in the eyes and tell me the truth. Were your friends Ive been prostituting myself to make some money, and hes my pimp. Things got mixed up. He thinks Im holding out on him. I didnt mean for this to happen. Billy .Billy I dont work for him anymore. Your clients, were they johns or tricks, Billy!? It doesnt matter. I dont do it anymore. It doesnt matter!? How the hell did you get involved with prostitution!? Are you taking drugs? Mom. What, were you a hooker, call boy, a kerb crawler? Where in the hell did you meet that man!? Were your clients johns or tricks? Theyre the same thing, and kerb crawlers are johns! .... also tricks What the hell is wrong with you!! I just needed some money to pay off some stuff. How much do you have to give him!? This is not the way you make money young man. How much Stop ganging up on me! Well it is time somebody ganged you for gods sake. A man like that. Where the hell did you meet a man like that!? It doesnt matter! It matters a great deal! A man holds a gun on you. You almost got killed! You expect me to forget that happened? You are not my fucking mother anymore! Thats why Im going to enjoy this so much! Pull down your pants, boy. Its time you got a belt whipping! No, no! Somebody had better do something around here! Its okay, its okay. Are you okay Billy? I m okay. Are you really okay? I m okay. Really? Yes You? Its okay. Whats okay? Hes involved with some sort of gang of hemale transhomo perverts! Come on, stop. It was a mistake. A mistake? That he leases his body to addicted drug homos? Let s go home Come on, its clear. Whats clear? All you did was stand and watch. Im going to call the police. Mom stop! It was Billys mistake, just stop! Let s go Why did you this? You know better, right? Why!? Im sorry. You know better Billy... you almost got killed! Im sorry, it wont happen again, I promise. Of course it wont. I made him.... go away. Im your older sister Billy, and you know that Johnny is like your father. We are going to help you. Im going home now. Are we still going to the movie tonight? Oh, sure we are. What kind of movie are we going to see. Vampires? Well well see. .. .Billy, dont plan too much, it may not come out right. Alright, lets toss the ball around. Okay I got to tell you about something. Shoot Billy. Its about me and you. Go on Youre just so cool and such a nice, caring guy. Everybody likes you and only a fat, stupid, idiotic, selfish jerk with a body odor problem would ever betray you. You help so many people and youve been so good to me. Go on I like you a lot, and I find myself sexually attracted to you. I know you love Lisa and I shouldnt think of you in that way, but I cant help it. I dont know, Im just confused. Billy, dont worry about that. Lisa and I love you too, as a person, as a human being, as a friend. You know people dont have to say it, they can feel it. What do you mean? You can love someone deep inside your heart and there is nothing wrong with it. If a lot of people love each other, the world will be a better place to live. But youre Lisas future husband. Billy, dont worry about it. The important thing is that you appreciate loyalty. You would never betray me and thats why I do things like pay your rent for you. In fact, and this is a secret, I have a small fortune built up that Im waiting to give away as a reward to all my friends who never betray me. You mean you are not upset at me? No, because I trust you and I trust Lisa, and Mark. You are part of our family and we love you very much, as a friend. But you are sort of like our son too, and we will help you anytime Well, youre right. Thanks for paying my tuition. Youre very welcome Billy. Keep in mind that if you have any problems, talk to me and I will help you. Awesome. Thanks Johnny. Lets go eat, huh. Come on, lets go. You must be starving. I am, Johnny. I am. Would you like something to drink? What do you have? Vodka, brandy, rum, tequila, applejack, vermouth, cognac, gin, and the whiskeys bourbon, scotch, rye and Canadian. I would go with the rum because its proof. Hit me with a double! Lets get this party started! Hows Johnny? Not so good. He didnt get his promotion. Im sorry to hear that. Was he disappointed? Quite a bit. He got drunk last night and hit me. Now hes on the roof trying to give advice to Billy. He hit you!?? How did that happen? He got drunk and didnt know what he was doing. You poor thing. Are you okay? Well, I dont want to marry him anymore. What??? I thought it was all planned. How is he in bed? Hes okay, but I found somebody else. What!?? And youre planning a birthday party for Johnny? Why not? He doesnt know anything about it. Pretty good, huh? Look, this is not right. You are living with a one guy and doing sex with another. Im doing what I want to. Does this new guy know Johnny? Hes his best friend who lives in this building. I dont believe youre telling me this. Its Mark, isnt it! Youre not thinking about Johnny or Mark. Youre just thinking about yourself, Lisa. You cant go on this way. Somebodys going to get hurt. You have to be honest with Johnny. You cant go on like this. I cant do that. What will it do to Johnny? He would be devastated and never recover. Oh, so youre saying you are thinking about him and not yourself? Well if you care so much for him, then why cheat on him? Look I really dont know what to do. I love Mark. I really dont have any more feelings for Johnny. Johnny is so excited about this wedding. I know. Youve got to tell Johnny. No guilt trips You dont feel guilty about this at all? No Im happy Something awful is going to happen. Please dont tell anybody. Dont worry, you can trust me. Youre secret is safe with me. Hello Michelle, I heard you. What secret? Its between us women. Hi Johnny. Did you get a new dress? Well I guess Id better be going. Ill just talk to you guys later? Excuse me. Lisa, remember what I told you. Whats she talking about? Its women talk. Only women can talk about it! I still dont believe I hit you. You shouldnt have any secrets from me. Im your future husband. Are you sure about that? Maybe Ill change my mind. Dont talk like that. What do you mean? What do you think? Women change their minds all the time. Ha, ha! You must be kidding, arent you? Look, I dont want to talk about it. Im going to go upstairs, wash up and go to bed. How dare you talk to me like that! You should tell me everything! What is it you dont want to talk about? I cant talk right now. Why Lisa! Why Lisa! Why dont you talk to me! Come on Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Talk to me please! Without you I would be nothing. You are my life, my everything, I could not go on without you Lisa. Youre scaring me. You are lying! I never hit you. You are taking me apart, Lisa! Why are you so hysterical!? Do you understand life? Do you understand life? Do you? Dont worry about it. Everything will be alright. You drive me crazy! Goodnight, Johnny. Dont worry about it, I still love you. Good night Lisa. You look really tired today mom, are you feeling okay? I didnt get much sleep last night. Why not? Whats wrong? You remember my friend Shirley Hamilton? She wants to buy a new house and I asked Johnny if he could help her with the down payment. All he can tell me is that its an awkward situation. I expected your husband to be a little more generous Hes not my husband. I know, but Johnny is part of our family. Mom, I dont love Johnny anymore. I dont even like him. I had sex with someone else. You cant be serious. You dont understand. Who, who is it? I dont want to talk about it. Oh no! Its that homework character with the underwear, isnt it! I gave you strict orders not to sleep with that goof ball. Well, thats it. You leave me no other option than to disown y Its not Bran! Look, I just dont want to talk about it. You dont want to talk about it. Then why did you bring it up in the first place? Have you lost your mind? Next thing youll be turning tricks like your brother. I dont know why I brought it up? You dont know? You really are going crazy. I have to go pick up my breast cancer medicine. Can you believe its going to cost me .? I think the whole thing was made up just so they can make some easy money. Imagine, taking advantage of an old defenseless lady whos losing her life. Mom, just take the medicine and youll be fine. Are you coming to the party? Sure, I suppose so. How can they say this about me? I dont believe it. Lisa has been unfaithful and that woman, her mother, cares more about her life threatening cancer than she does about me. Ill show them. Ill record everything. Hey Johnny, whats going on? Oh hi Bran, whats new? Actually Johnny, I got a little bit of a tragedy on my hands. Did Michelle betray you or something? No, nothing horrible like that! Id probably kill myself if she ever did that. Who wouldnt? So tell me what happened. Me and Michelle were making out, at your place. Uh huh. And Lisa and Claudette sort of walked in on us in the middle of it. Thats not the end of the story. Go on, Im listening. Were going at it and I get out of there as fast as possible. I get my pants, I get my shirt, and I get out of there. And then about half way down the stairs, I realize that I had misplaced, I had forgotten something ... .my underwear. Underwear? So I come back to get it, you know, and I pretend that I need a book, you know Im looking for my book. I reach in and put the underwear in my pocket and it sort of slides out, and Claudette, she saw it sticking out of my pocket, and she pulls it out and shes showing everybody me underwears. You must be kidding. Underwear, I got the picture. I dont know what to do? Underwear, thats life. Hey Johnny. Hey Billy. Do you guys want to play some football? I have to go see Michelle in a little bit, to make out with her. So Im sorry. Oh come on Whats the matter Bran, are you chicken? CHIP! CHIP!!! Ha Ha! CHIP! CHIP! Ha Ha! Oh hi Mark! Okay guys whatever Hey whats up Mark? Hey Billy, whats up? Let s go for it Im going out. Sorry you had to see that. Im not sorry. Studying right? I dont study like that. I bet you wish you did. Catch it. Whats going on you guys? Hes just telling us about an underwear issue. Underwear? Whats that? Its embarrassing man. I dont want to get into it. Underwear .... It s the underpants man! Does anyone know CPR? I do! Bran, are you okay? Are you okay? Im fine. Sure? Uh huh. Do you want to go see a doctor? No, no, no. Im good, Im alright. Im fine. Yeah Mark, take him to a doctor, and Bran, listen if you need anything call me anytime alright. We are very good friends and I will do everything in my power to help you get better. Take care of him Mark! Oh man.... oh man, oh man. Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war.... Oh hi Peter, Im so glad you stopped by. Come in and have a seat. Ill get some water for us to drink. I dont understand women. Do you Peter? Of course I do Im a psychologist. Whats the problem? They never say what they mean, and they always play games. Okay, what do you mean? I have a serious problem with Lisa. I dont think shes being faithful to me. In fact, I know she isnt. Lisa? Are you sure? Im sure. I overheard a conversation between Lisa and her mother, and I recorded some phone conversations she had with a guy who has a voice that coincidentally sounds very similar to the voice of Mark, who is my best friend. What should I do Peter? This is Lisa we are talking about? Yeah Are you sure? Yes What would you like me to say? You are a psychologist, Peter. Dont you have some advice? I am an expert, thats true, and its not a very complicated situation. But Johnny, you are my friend and I dont want to get between you and Lisa. Look, I think you should confront her and show her whos the man of the house. I cant confront her, I have to give her a second chance. After all shes my future wife. You know what they say, love is blind. Its not about love, Johnny. Its about control, and the best way to control a female is to make them emotionally dependent on you. You didnt do that, so Lisa found it somewhere else. Did you hear the door? Yeah Oh hi Mark, come in. Oh hey Johnny. Hey Peter. We are just talking about women. Women, man, women just confuse me. Cant live with them, cant live without them, but we need them for baby making. I have a girl, but shes married. Shes very attractive. Its driving me crazy. Why didnt you mention this before? Im a psychologist. Is it anyone I know? What do you mean, is it someone you know? Can I meet her? Why would you want to do that, Johnny? I mean, well, um, what would Lisa think? Its an awkward situation. Oh I see. You mean shes too old or you think I will take her away from you? Huh? No! I have my own problems. Tell me about your problems Johnny. Peter, you always play psychologist with us. Look, I may be your friend, but by profession I am a psychologist, and that makes me an expert on these issues. Lisa is teasing me about whether we will get married or not, and we havent made love in awhile. I dont know what to do. What kind of man are you Johnny? People are people. Sometimes they cant see their own faults, so they need someone to tell them. You have to give it to her straight. It takes two to tango Johnny, and if all she has are two left feet shell just end up stepping all over your toes. Youre going to get hurt Hey Im thinking of moving to a better place man. Im making some good money. Look, you should tell her the truth. You are doing this for your girl, right? You are right Peter! Is she getting a divorce Mark? You guys are too much! Hey, are you running Bay to Breakers this year? I am, sure. No, Im not going this year. Ha, ha!! Chicken Peter, you are just a little chicken!!! Chip!!! Chip!!! Chip!!!! Chip!!!!! Chip!!!! Ha Ha! Squeak! Squeak! Honk! Little Chicken! Who are you guys calling a chicken? I just dont like all the weirdos. Theres too many weirdos. I dont mind. Mark, do you remember the one with the big tits, the blonde one? How about the one with the bridal gown and the sign? Oh yeah, Please Marry Me. I almost took her up on it. I never ate so much bread. The barbecue chicken and rice was delicious. That was cool. You guys proved my point. You are both weird. You guys want to play cards? No, we cant. I expect Lisa any minute. Hey, whos king of the house? Yeah, you have to establish these guidelines before you get married. How did you meet Lisa? you never told us. Its a very interesting story. When I moved to San Francisco I had two suitcases and I didnt know anyone. I hit the YMCA with a two thousand dollar check that I couldnt cash. Why not? Because it was an out of state bank. Anyway, I was working as a bus boy in a hotel and Lisa was sitting, drinking her coffee and she was so beautiful, and I say hi to her. Thats how we met. So, whats the interesting part? Oh give us a break Mark! Isnt it obvious? A two thousand dollar out of state bank issued check that he cant cash? Ha Ha Ha! Thats quite the conundrum. Ill bet its never been cashed, has it. Youre right Peter, on both counts. I had the uncashed check laminated and placed in a photo album, which is indeed very interesting. But, even more interesting is that Lisa was living in San Francisco at the time. So? Dont you see, Mark? Lisa had her own home in the city. She did not need to stay in a hotel. She had some kind of inexplicable urge to spend the night in that very hotel, during my shift. It was meant to be! What, no tips from your job? Whatever, do you guys want to eat something? Hey guys. Whats going on? Oh, hey Lisa. Hey Lisa. Wheres Johnny? Hes in the kitchen. I got to go. I didnt mean to chase you off. I wish youd stick around for awhile Are you crazy? I have to be at work early. See ya. Why are you sitting on the floor Billy? Its hard to explain, you wouldnt understand. You son of a bitch!!! What the hell is the matter with you!? Youre the reason I drink! If you dont get up this instant Im going to belt whip you so hard youll wish you were going to the moon! There, are you happy now? I am happy!!! Look Billy! I have to talk to Johnny! Ill see you later Will you tell him I said hello? Alright! Yes Oh, hi Mark. Whats happening? Hi Peter. This is a good place to think, huh? You wanna put me on the clock? Whats that? You want some? No man. You know I dont smoke that stuff. You look depressed. I got this sick feeling in my stomach. I did something awful. I just cant forgive myself. Why dont you tell me about it? Well, I feel like running, or killing myself. Something crazy like that. Why are you smoking that crap? No wonder you cant think straight. That stuff will mess up your brain. Anyway, its none of your business. Why are you so nosy? You think you know everything. You dont know shit. Just a minute. Who do you think you are? Youre acting like a kid. Grow up. Who are you calling a kid? Fuck you! Cool it Mark. Im just trying to help you. I know youre having an affair with Lisa. Am I wrong? Wake up man. Wake up What are you doing? Are you crazy? Im sorry, I didnt mean it. Youre my best friend. Are you okay? Dont worry about it. Lets just talk about your problem. Are you sure youre okay? Why do you want to know my secret? Well, youre right, its Lisa. I dont know what to do Im so depressed. I think Ill kill myself. Johnny is my best friend. Shes so manipulative. How did this happen? If Johnny finds out that will be the end of your friendship. What were you thinking? Look, life is very complex, but you have to face it. You should have to be responsible. My advice to you is that you should stop thinking about her, and never do sex with her. Find another girl. Thats my advice. Lisas a sociopath. She only cares about herself, and shes incapable of loving anyone. Whatever Peter. Lets go. Oh thank you. Thanks a lot. Oh hi Billy. That was some funeral wasnt it. Yeah, Im just glad its over. Billy, we had to make sure Jimmy was really dead. Now that we all saw him lain down in that funeral casket we can be sure hell never trouble you ever again for his money. Theres just some things I dont understand Johnny. Like what? Death? The meaning of life? Love? No, I mean what happened at the police station. Didnt you take Jimmy straight there? Its all very strange. Well you know, the police have to deal with all sorts of crazy people. So, sometimes at the station the police have to do what may seem to us like some strange things. But they said all his blood was sucked out of his body. Some very .... strange things. Hey Peter, come in. Its too bad about Jimmy. I know he was a bad guy, but that was just crazy. Besides, funerals are so depressing. Hey thats life. Have a seat Peter. Wow! Wow! Hey guys. You like it? You look great. You look like babyface. Whats the occasion Mark? I started a new job and they told me I cant show up there looking like a caveman. So there you have it. What did you think of the funeral Mark? We were looking for you. What funeral? Okay Hey, you guys want to play some catch the football? In tuxes, you gotta be kidding? Come on Mark, lets do it. I m up for it Johnny? Ask Mr. GlassesHead over there. Come on Peter No, I dont think so. Please?? Come on. CHIP!!!!! Catch Johnny! Nice snag! All right Peter! Here we go Mark! Come on Catch Mark. Go go Gee Mark, why dont you try NOT hurting someone for a change. Its not his fault. Its those damn drugs! Come on, lets go see a doctor. Bye Lisa. Hello mom. How are you? Im okay. How are you? There it us again. What are you talking about? That clicking noise. The phones been making a strange sound lately You should report it to the phone company. Utilities are very expensive these days. Did you call a repair technician? No, I think Ill just by a new phone. Theres a RadioShack nearby Well, as long as Johnnys paying for it. So, how are you? Im fixing the apartment for Johnnys birthday, but Im really not into it. Why not? Oh, I dont want to get married. I love Mark. Dont you understand that? Its not right Lisa. You should still keep Johnny because hes very independent, and you aint. Think about the money. Yeah, but Im not happy anymore. Before I met Mark I didnt think he would blow my mind. What are you talking about? You werent meant to be happy. I havent been happy since I got married for the first time. I didnt want to marry your dad either. Ive been miserable since then. Its true, men are all assholes. You have to use them and abuse them. Theres nothing wrong with that. I know. Johnnys okay, and I have him wrapped around my little finger. Well, then you should be happy. But, I dont love him. Dont throw your life away just because you dont love him. Thats ridiculous. Youve got to grow up and listen to me. Okay, Ill see you at the party then. Bye Hi, can I have a hot chocolate please? Oh hi Johnny! I didnt know it was you. What size would you like? Medium. Sure How about you? Ill have a mint tea. Medium also? Whatever floats your boat. Go sit down. Well be right there. Man, Im so tired of girls games. What happened now Mark? Relationships never work man, I dont know why I waste my time What makes you say that? Its not that easy Johnny. Well, you should be happy Mark. Yeah I know. Life is too short. Maybe for you it is Oh thank you Susan. Youre welcome. Now how about something you can really get into with a fork, like cheesecake? No! No, not today, maybe some other day. But thanks for thinking about it Real good. Okay then. Fine, alright. How was work today? Pretty good. We got a new client and the bank will make a lot of money. What client? Do I know him? Whats his name? I cant tell you, its confidential. Oh come on man, why not? I thought we were best friends. No, I cannot. Anyway, hows your sex life? I cant talk about it. Why not, are you hiding something? Take your time You son of a bitch!!! I didnt order this! Whats wrong!? Oh, whoops. I made a mistake, you were right. Oh god I have to run. Already? Yeah, Im sorry.

Hi Mark, XYZ What are you talking about? Are you crazy or something? Examine your zipper. It seems okay to me Come on you guys, Im trying to prepare for the party. So what can i do to help? You can help by telling me whats wrong with my zipper. What was he doing here? Oh, he brought some takeout. What about his zipper!!!! Leave him alone. Hes a nice guy. No, I meandid something happen? He tried to rape me, but I didnt let him. Did you tell Johnny yet? No, they are good friends. I know. Tricky! Tricky! You know, I really loved Johnny at first. Really? I thought you loved him now. Until now I did. I think I still love him. Everythings changed. I need more from life than what Johnny can give me. Suddenly my eyes are wide open and I see the light. I want it all. Do you think you can get it all from Mark? I want to play the field. If he doesnt give me what I want then somebody else will. I think I dont know you anymore. You are being so manipulative Lisa. So what, you can learn from me. You have to take as much as you can. You have to live, live, live my friend. Dont worry, I have everything covered. Tell me more. Maybe I can understand your point of view. Look, I dont want to talk about it. Lets put this stuff in bowls. We only have an hour before people start coming. I want to know, its important to me. Youre my best friend. This really upsets me. I dont know what the big mystery is. Doesnt everybody look out for number one? Arent I worth it? Dont I deserve the best? I cant do that. You are too much for me Lisa. Youre not such an angel yourself. Were not talking about me. Stop it, theyll be here any minute. Are you trying to ruin my party? Im with you, lets talk later. It looks to me like were ready. We sure fooled Johnny, didnt we. He doesnt suspect a thing! We could carry on right under his nose and he wouldnt be the wiser. He still thinks Im his best friend! Johnny does whatever I tell him. I have him totally whipped. The best part is he totally trusts me and thinks I will never betray him. I know. What a dope! Har har har!!! Hes as good in bed as he is at getting promotions.... Awful! Hi honey, happy birthday! Thank you. Surprise Happy Birthday to you, happy birthday to you... Oh wow! Happy Birthday dear Johnny... Wow, alright, thank you. Happy Birthday to you. Thank you, thank you. And many more Ill talk to you later. Hey everybody, lets go outside for some fresh air! Wait, I have something i want to show you. What is it? So, what do you want to show me? Its a surprise. Oh, I love surprises! But what are you doing? Are you crazy? Everybodys here. No theyre not. Theyre all outside. Lisa, you diabolical .... you planned this all along! Now wheres the surprise? Whats going on here!? Why are you doing this Its a surprise! Mark and I are two consenting adults. We have the right. Well I dont approve. Now I want to know why you are doing this Why I love him. I dont believe it. You dont understand anything. Leave your stupid comments in your pocket. Excuse me? MY stupid comments!? Heres some words of wisdom for YOU, you comment making idiot. You think your opinions are so important and that you possess some naturalborn expertise. But take it from ME, a REAL expert, when I say that your comments are even more stupider than you, the very person making them. Now, I have a lot of experience, so when I say something, it counts. Thats because Im very important and I know what Im talking about, unlike feebleminded you. I see you want to make a retort with a comment, do you? PSHAW!!! You cant make a comment because youre speechless, and youre too AFRAID. Besides, No one wants to hear your stupidness anyway. Do you understand what you are doing? You are going to destroy Johnny. He is very sensitive. I dont care. Im in love with Mark. How can you do this? You make me sick! Thank you honey, this is a beautiful party. You invited all my friends. Good thinking. Youre welcome darling. You know how much I love you. I do, Ha Ha Ha. You know, its getting really hot in here. Why dont we go back outside. Uh huh. Hey everybody, I have an announcement to make. We are expecting Lisa, you have to be honest with Johnny. I agree with that. You know whats going on? Urn hmmm. Look, Im going to tell him. I just dont want to spoil his birthday When is the baby due? There is no baby. What What are you talking about? I just told him that to make it interesting. Anyway, well probably have a baby eventually. You wont say anything to Johnny, will you? This is just getting worse and worse. I feel like Im sitting on an atomic bomb waiting for it to go off. Me too. Theres no simple solution to this. Dont worry. You guys worry entirely too much about me. Lisa, were not worried about you, we are worried about Johnny. You dont understand the psychological impact of what you are doing here. Youre hurting yourself, you are hurting OUR friendship. Actually its more like a thermonuclear bomb Im sitting on, using the primary fission reaction from the atomic bomb I was previously sitting on to compress and ignite a secondary hydrogen based fusion reaction. I am not responsible for Johnny. Im through with that. Im changing, the whole worlds changing. I have the right, dont I? People are changing all the time. I have to think about my future. Whats it to you? This is going to pull us all down, its going to shake up our group of friends. Its going to destroy our friendship Lisa, its going to destroy everything, just like in that movie. Dr. Strangelove. Except, I dont think Mark really loves you. I dont want to talk about it! Lisa, you are going to have to face it. I for one, am going to have a hard time forgiving you if you dont. Hey everybody, lets go inside and eat some cake! I dont understand you Lisa. Women. Theyre all the same. Lisa looks hot tonight. Come on, whos baby is it Lisa? Is it mine? No, of course not. How can you be sure anyway? Are you sure its not mine? Dont ask me any stupid questions! Who the hell do you think you are!? Just shut up! Whats going on here? You really dont know, do you? He hurt my arm. I know more than you think I do, Mark. Whats that supposed to mean? Precisely what I said. Thats why I chose the words. You dont know shit! What do you want from me? What do you want from me! I want you to just disappear, you little twerp. You leave Lisa alone, prick. Stop! Stop! Stop! Peter! Michelle! Help!!! Help!!!.... Knock it off Peter! What are you doing, are you crazy? Peter cant be crazy! Hes an expert psychologist! Hey Peter, Whats the difference between a psychologist and a duck? I dont know. What? Ones a quack, the others a duck. The fights over folks, everythings fine. Sorry about that Mark. Yeah, yeah. Me too. Lisa, can we have a big mop here? You guys knock it off. Youre just making more work for me. Towels, anyone? Yeah, Ill take one, maybe a couple. Maid service, thank goodness What are you doing? None of your business. You are my future wife.
