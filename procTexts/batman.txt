Harvey Dent was needed. He was everything Gotham has been crying out for He was ... a hero Not the hero we deserved the hero we needed. Nothing less than a knight, shining The sound of cracking. Splintering. A shape appears, in ice. The shape of a BAT. The ice disintegrates... Gordon stands before a massive picture of Harvey Dent. But I knew Harvey Dent. I was... his friend. And it will be a very long time before someone inspires us the way he did. Gordon, choked with emotion, gathers the papers of his eulogy I believed in Harvey Dent. And we FADE TO BLACK. Racing along a cratered dirt road, and we are Three Hooded Men guarded by East European Militia. A third Militia drives. Next to him is a nervous, bespectacled man. An airstrip overlooking a grey city rocked by artillery fire. A bland CIA Operative, flanked by Special Forces Men, stands in front of a commuter plane. CIA Man watches the Land Cruiser pull up, hard. The Militia Men jump out of the vehicle The Driver shoves the bespectacled man in front of the CIA Man Dr. Pavel, Im CIA. Dr. Pavel nods, nervous. CIA Man hands the Driver a briefcase He wasnt alone. CIA Man, confused, spots the Hooded Men. He turns to Dr. Pavel You dont get to bring friends. shaken They are not my friends. Dont worry, no charge for them. Why would I want them? They were trying to grab your prize. Smiles. They work for the mercenary. The masked man. excited Bane The Driver nods. CIA Man turns to his Special Forces Men. Get em on board Ill call it in. The commuter plane struggles over snowcapped mountains. The three Hooded Men kneel by the cargo door, handcuffed. CIA Man grabs Hooded Man What are you doing in the middle of my operation? Hooded Man says nothing. CIA Man pulls out a handgun. The flight plan I just filed with the Agency lists me, my men, and Dr. Pavel here. But only one of you CIA Man opens the cargo door. Special Forces hang Hooded Man out into the howling wind CIA Man shouts above the wind. MY AIRCRAFT! Cocks weapon. Nothing. CIA Man fires out the open door and the special Forces yank Hooded Man back in, clubbing him quiet. The soldiers grab Hooded Man hang him out the door. The prisoner says nothing. CIA Man presses the gun to the mans hood he cocks the gun ... nothing Or hes wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of an aeroplane. CIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner. Shuts the cargo door. Wiseguy, huh? At least you can talk. Who are you? We are nothing. We are the dirt beneath your feet And no one cared who I was until I put on the mask CIA Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner pulls off his hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus. The eyes behind it are cold. Still. This is Bane. Who we are does not matter. What matters is our plan. fascinated If I pull this off, will you die? It would be extremely painful Youre a big guy For you. unnerved Was being caught part of your plan? Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours. We had to know what he told you about us. Nothing! I said nothing! Why not just ask him? He would not have told us. You have methods. Him, I need healthy. You present no such problem. CIA Man laughs for the special Forces benefit. A heavy bass tone is rising. The sergeant looks out the window. The commuter plane is dwarfed by a massive transport plane looming over it, dangerously close... The plane lurches. The noise is building. Sir? Well congratulations, you got yourselves caught. Whats the next step of your master plan? Crashing this plane... The ramp of the transport opens... Four men leap out on tethers dropping towards the commuter plane, two each side The spacial Forces react to the turbulence from the plane above. CIA Man looks at Bane. rising With no survivors A Special Forces soldier spins around an Armed Man is outside the window. Bang Two men shoot through the windows, the other two attach grapples to the fuselage give the thumbs up hoists start to pull and the tail of the commuter plane is lifted, unnaturally The Pilots battle the controls as the plane tilts forward. Like lightning. Bane has the CIA Man is his handcuffed arms, legs wrapped around a seat back. The entire cabin upends. Tumbling chaos Soldiers falling Bane cracks CIA Mans neck and drops him onto the sergeant they tumble down the plane, smashing into the cockpit door with a terminal thud. Dr. Pavel, strapped in, pushes against the seat in front of him the plane vibrates, trying to tear itself apart. The men climb the tail of the smaller plane as it dangles helplessly above the mountains. Its wings shear off. Bane breaks his handcuffs as if they were plastic, then opens his legs and drops down the cabin, somersaulting gracefully and using his arms to stop himself halfway down, by Dr Pavel The men attach explosives to the tail, then jump away, swinging out as the tail explodes. An explosion takes off the rear door of the cabin the Armed Men drop through the smoke on cables. A body bag is lowered into the cabin. Bane lies it on the seat backs next to Dr. Pavel and unzips it to reveal a body the same age and build as Dr. Pavel. Bane rips Dr. Pavels sleeve pulls out a length of surgical tubing pushes a needle into Dr. Pavels arm runs the tube to the bodys arm... Dr. Pavel watches, horrified, as Bane starts compressions on the bodys chest, drawing Dr. Pavels blood across the tube and into the body An Armed Man pulls Hooded Man up through the cabin and out Bane stops Hooded Man Friend. They expect one of us in the wreckage. The man nods, unhooks himself, takes Banes arm. Have we started the fire? nods The fire rises. Hooded Man hands Bane his line. Bane clips it around Dr. Pavel, takes out a knife and cuts Dr. Pavels seat belt. Dr Pavel panics, flails. Bane takes his arms. Gentle. Calm, Doctor. Now is not time for fear Bane slides Dr. Pavel out of his seat. They hang in the vertical, windblown cabin. Bane takes out a detonator. That comes later. Bane presses the detonator the cabin drops from around them, revealing the terrifying drop to the peaks below. Dr. Pavel screams as they are hoisted up towards the transport, and we Drifting over the vast city. Harvey Dent Day may not be our oldest public holiday ...moving past the enormous Gotham Bridge... But were here tonight because its one of the most important ...over the Gotham river to the Palisades on the far side.. Harvey Dents uncompromising stand against organized crime and, yes, ultimately, his sacrifice, have made Gotham a safer place than it was at the time of his death, eight years ago ...finding a party in the grounds of Wayne Manor. The Mayor addresses the wealthy and powerful of Gotham. This city has seen a historic turnaround. No city is without crime. But this city is without organized crime because the Dent Act gave law enforcement teeth in its fight against the mob. Now people are talking about repealing the Dent Act And to them I say. .not on my watch. Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up. I want to thank the Wayne Foundation for hosting this event. Im told Mr. Wayne couldnt be here tonight, but Im sure hes with us in spirit High above, on a darkened balcony, a lone figure. Watching. Now Im going to give way to an important voice... Down below at the bar. Commissioner Gordon examines some sheets of densely written paper. A Congressman muscles in. Commissioner Congressman Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of these things? Gordon shakes his head. Gordons Deputy Commissioner, Foley, cuts in. No one has Not in years He can tell you about the bad old days, when the criminals and corrupt ran this town with such a tight grasp that people put their faith in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape. A thug who showed his true nature when he betrayed the trust of this great man Turns to picture of Dent. And murdered him in cold blood. The Congressman watches a tray of canapes breeze past, then grabs the ass of the maid carrying them. She freezes. Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow turns, tight smile Shrimp balls? The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The Congressman glances down at Gordons papers. Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about Harvey Dent Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech? Were gonna be here all night. Maybe the truth about Harvey isnt so simple. Congressman. But Ill let him tell you himself Commissioner Gordon? Applause. Gordon approaches the mike. Looks down at his long speech. Thinks. The truth INSERT CUT Harvey Dent, face half destroyed, threatens Gordons son with a handgun. Gordon surveys the audience. Deciding. I have written a speech telling the truth about Harvey Dent Gordon folds up his speech. Maybe the time isnt right... Gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket. The Congressman mutters under his breath. Thank Christ for that... Maybe right now all you need to know is that there are a thousand inmates in Blackgate Prison as a direct result of the Dent Act. These are violent criminals, essential cogs in the organized crime machine that terrorized Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now, all I should say about Harvey Dents death is this... it has not been for nothing. The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion. People clap as Gordon leaves the mike. Gordon approaches Foley The second shift reports in? On your desk. But you should put in some more time with the Mayor Thats your department. Gordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive. Anyone shown him the crime stats? He goes by his gut, and it continues to bother him, whatever the numbers Must be popular with the wife. Not really. She took the kids and moved to Cleveland. Hell have plenty of time for visits. Mayors dumping him in the spring Really? Hes a hero. War hero. This is peacetime. Stay smart, the jobs yours. Our Maid dives into the bustle of Wayne Manor below stairs Caterers and Maids, Wait Staff. She overhears another Maid. They say he never leaves the East Wing I heard he had an accident that hes disfigured. The other Maids signal her to be quiet. All the chatter has died. Alfred has entered the kitchen. Mr. Till, why are your people using the main stairs? Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered plate. Picks up the tray, looks around the chaotic kitchen. Wheres Mrs. Bolton? Shes up at the bar, sir. Can I help? Alfred looks at the Maid. Hands her a key and the tray. The East drawing room. Unlock the door, place the tray on the table, lock the door again. Nothing more. The Maid nods. Takes the tray. Following the Maid through the empty house. She comes to the large oak door to the East Wing. Unlocks it... The room is dark, quiet. The Maid places the tray on the table. She looks at the inner door opposite. It is ajar... Alfred talks to an elegant woman, thirties, Miranda Tate. Im sorry. Miss Tate, but Ive tried. He wont see you. Its important, Mr. Pennyworth. Her accent is European. Hard to place. Mr. Wayne is as determined to ignore important things as trivial ones Dont take it personally, Miranda. They turn to see a man in his fifties. Daggett. Everyone knows Waynes holed up in there with eightinch nails, peeing into Mason jars. To Alfred. Good of you to let me on the grounds The Dent Act is about all Gotham. Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate, always a pleasure. Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib. Why waste your time talking to the man who threw away your investment on some savetheworld vanity project? He cant help you get your money back. But I can. I could try explaining that a savetheworld project, vain or not, is worth investing in, whatever the return. I could try, Mr. Daggett, but you understand only money and the power you think it buys, so why waste my time, indeed? She walks away. Daggett watches her go. Close on the dinner tray. We hear a labored step approach. Bruce Wayne appears, leaning on a cane. Gaunt. Grey temples. He lifts the lid of his dinner, then freezes, hearing something. He'slowly limps into the next room. The Maid looks at framed photographs of Rachel, Thomas and Martha Wayne. Some are halfburned. She notices an archery target, arrows stuck in it. She reaches out. WHAM! An arrow sticks into the target the Maid spins around, flustered. Wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite bow. Picks up his cane. Im, Im terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne. It is Mr. Wayne, isnt it? Wayne nods, gently. Limps towards her. Although you dont have the long nails... Nervous laugh. Or facial scars She trails off, embarrassed. Coy. SHe'seems very young. Is that what they say about me? Its just that ... nobody sees you... Wayne approaches slowly. He nods at her pearl necklace. Thats a beautiful necklace. Reminds me of the one that belonged to my mother. It cant be the same one her pearls are in this safe He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the bureau, revealing a safe door... which the manufacturer clearly explained is uncrackable. ...which swings open with an awkward creak. Oops. No one told me it was uncrackable The Maid suddenly seems more confident. Older. Im afraid I cant let you take those SHe'smiles at him. Moves towards him. Look, you wouldnt hit a woman any more than I would beat up a cripple She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down. Of course, sometimes exceptions have to be made. The Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window. Goodnight, Mr. Wayne. She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace. He looks at the safe, notices something. Powder... Moving toward the line of town cars, the Maid pulls off her white apron, cuffs and collar, leaving a black dress and pearls. A Valet hurries to open a car door for her sHe'slips into a town car... beside the Congressman. Can I have a ride? The Congressman, a little tipsy, looks at her hungrily. You read my mind. Alfred enters, to find Wayne kneeling at the safe. Miss Tate was asking to see you again Shes very persistent. And quite lovely, in case you were wondering I wasn t What are you doing? Examining print dust. Weve been robbed And this is your idea of raising the alarm? shrugs She took the pearls. Tracking device and all She? One of the maids, perhaps you should stop letting them in this side of the house. Perhaps you should learn to make your own bed, then. Why are you dusting for prints? Im not. She was. Gordon brings a stack of files against the air duct, settles to read. Next to him is a rusty, broken searchlight. Sir? A young Cop is standing there. This is Blake. I didnt want to bother you up here, but theyre looking for you. Whats the problem, son? Congressman Gillys wifes been calling. He hasnt made it home from the Wayne Foundation event. Thats a job for the police? Sir, Ive been a cop for a year and Ive only logged half a dozen arrests. When you and Dent cleaned the streets you cleaned em good. Pretty soon we be chasing overdue library books. Gordon smiles at this. Blake looks at his stack of files. But here you are. Like were still at war Old habits. Or instinct Whats your name, son? Blake, sir. You have something you want to ask me. Officer Blake? Its that night. This night, eight years ago. The night Dent died. What about it? The last confirmed sighting of the Batman. He murders those people, takes out two SWAT teams, breaks Dents neck... then just vanishes Im not hearing a question, son. Blake shifts uneasily. Then looks at Gordon. Dont you want to know who we was? Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushes his fingers across its rusted shell. I know exactly who he was. Turns to Blake. He was Batman. Gordon walks past Blake, heading for the stairs. Lets go see about the Congressman s wife. Alfred takes his tray into the bedroom. The bed is empty. Master Wayne? Alfreds voice echoes through the vast mansion. No reply. Alfred hits three notes on the piano. The bookcase opens. Alfred descends into the caverns beneath Wayne Manor. Alfred walks through the arches as the stone floor starts to lower, becoming a ramp. At the bottom, Alfred is level with a series of dark slate obelisks a bridge over the water to where Wayne sits at a computer atop a massive slate cube. You havent been down here in a long time Just trying to find out more about our jewel thief. I ran her prints from the photos she handled Wayne pulls up a mug shot a fat, male armedrobbery suspect but she was wearing someone elses fingerprints. Shes good. She may be. But we have the trace on the necklace. We do, so I crossreferenced the address she went back to with police data on highend BandE s Wayne hits a key. A photograph of the Maid appears. Selina Kyle. The databases are full of close calls, tips from fences... Newspaper headlines appear Shes good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet. We should send the police before she fences the pearls. She wont. She likes them too much. And they werent what she was after What was she after? My fingerprints. There was printer toner mixed with graphite on the safe. Gives you a good pull, and its untraceable. Fascinating. Maybe you should exchange notes over coffee. Now youre trying to set me up with a jewel thief? At this point, sir, I would set you up with a chimpanzee if I thought it would bring you back into the world Theres nothing out there for me. And thats the problem. You hung up the cape and cowl, but never moved on. You wont get out there and find a life. Find someone bitter I did find someone, Alfred. I know. And then you lost them. Thats part of living, sir. But youre not living youre waiting. Hoping for things to go bad again. Wayne says nothing. Remember when you left Gotham? Before all this. Before Batman. Seven years you were gone. Seven years I waited. Hoping that you wouldnt come back. Wayne looks at Alfred. Not understanding. Every year I took my holiday. Id go to Florence. Theres a cafe by the Arno. Any fine evening I would sit there and order a Fernet Branca INSERT CUT Alfred seated in a cafe sipping his drink... I had a fantasy. I liked to imagine that one day Id look across the tables, and see you. Sitting there with your wife. Perhaps some kids. You wouldnt say anything to me, or me to you, but wed both know... that youd made it. That you were happy. INSERT CUT Alfred spots a couple at another table and looks closer, hopeful. But they are strangers. I never wanted you to come back to Gotham. I knew there was nothing there for you but pain and tragedy, and I wanted more for you than that. I still do. Alfred leaves Wayne to his cave. His bats. Blake and his partner, Ross, get out of their patrol car. A DWP Man leads them down a long concrete trough. They wash up a couple times a month. More when in gets colder homeless sheltering in the tunnels. We had to pull him to clear the basin, but other than that we didnt touch him... They come out by the catchment basin. Above the grille lies a body a teenage boy. Blake looks down at him. Freezes. What? Names Jimmy. Hes at St. Swithins. Off look. The boys home where I... I coach some ball. Blake looks up at the shabby building. Blake is talking to Father Reilly. Jimmy hadnt been here for months. Why? You know why, Blake he aged out. We dont have the resources to keep boys on after sixteen The Wayne Foundation gives money for that Not for two years now. He has a brother here, right? Mark. Ill tell him. Id like to, if thats okay. Father Reilly watches as Blake sits with Mark ten. Im sorry. Mark nods slowly. Staring straight ahead. What was he doing in the tunnels? Lot of guys been going down the tunnels when they age out. Say you can live down there. Say theres work down there. What kind of work are you gonna find in the sewers? More than you can find up here, I guess Blake considers this. Troubled. Selina Kyle, in a little black dress, walks in with a drunk in a Hawaiian shirt. SHe'sits him on a bar stool walks over to a table where a neatly dressed man, Stryver, sits. You brought a date? I like having someone around to open doors for me. Selina glances around. Things scattered throughout the bar. Jumpy. Selina hands an envelope to Stryver. Right hand. No partials. Stryver slides a transparency out of the envelope. Holds it up to the light. Four perfect fingerprint transfers. Very nice. He pockets the envelope. Not so fast, handsome. You got something for me? Oh, yes. Stryver signals a Thug who locks the door. Another Thug joins them at the table. Selina smiles. I dont know what youre going to do with Mr. Waynes prints... but Im guessing youll need his thumb. As Stryver checks the envelope again You dont count so good, huh? I count fine. The second Thug puts a gun to Selinas head. In fact, Im counting to ten right now Selina looks in his eyes. The Thug cocks his gun. She blinks Okay, okay She reaches for her purse. The Thug stops her, reaches in himself pulls out a cellphone. Slides it across the table. My friend is waiting outside. Just hit send Stryver looks at the phone. Hits send Selina sizes up her options. A knock on the door. Second Thug hides his gun. The door opens a young woman, Jen. She enters, cheerful, spots Selina. Pulls out an envelope, looks around. Place is a little dead. takes envelope, tense Itll liven up in a minute, trust me Everything okay? Great. Catch you later. Jen leaves. Stryver checks the envelope. Satisfied. It wouldve been a lot easier to just give me what we agreed. We cant have loose ends. And even in that dress, no ones going to miss you. No. But my friend over there...? Stryver looks at Selinas date drooling into a bowl of nuts at the bar he looks familiar... Every cop in the city s missing him Across the bar, the TV on mute Stryver looks at Selina. Cute. But theyre not gonna be looking in a place like this. I dont know. You did just use his cell phone. Stryver glances down at the cell phone as SCREECH the Thugs look out the window at cop cars and SWAT units descending on the bar. Stryver glances at the window and SMASH Selina CRACKS his head against the table, grabs Second Thugs gun hand, flips over the table, firing at the other Thugs, who drop. The sWATs batter down the door. Selina crouches, cowering, screaming. Its alright. Miss. Just stay down The sWATs barrel past, chasing the remaining Thugs back through the bar and out into the back alley. Selina smiles. The Thugs turn and open up on the sWATs with automatic weapons Selina moves to the door. Spots the Congressman under the bar, clutching his bleeding leg. Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart She adjusts her dress in the broken mirror behind the bar. Moves for the door. weak Call me? Selina waltzes out right into Blake. She feigns panic. Theres a man in there hes bleeding Its okay. Miss. Its okay. Blake helps Selina down onto the tailgate of a SWAT truck. He heads into the bar, weapon drawn. Selina slips behind the truck and into the night Blake enters, gun drawn. Spots the Congressman. into radio Ive got the Congressman bullet to the leg, but hes okay. The sWATs return fire. The Thugs lay down cover fire, then race around a corner into a smaller passage. A cop car pulls up, blocking the mouth of the alley Gordon jumps out, gun drawn. The sWATs approach the passage, massing on both corners tactically. The two corner SWATs exchange hand signals, counting down... They round the corner, aiming low and high. The passage is empty. The sWATs cover a fire escape, but Gordon spots at once Manhole He races to the manhole cover SWATs wrench off the cover, Gordon grabs a flashlight from the nearest SWAT. You three, down with me. You two, head down to cover the next exit Where Get the DWP down here, now! Gordon starts climbing down the ladder... Gordon moves down the tunnel, flashlight low. Three SWATs fall in behind. Blake comes into the alley. Cops surround the manhole. Wheres the DWP guy? They went down there? shaking his head And Gordon took SWAT in after them. Gordon hears a noise up ahead pushes forward, rounds the corner. BANG! GUNFIRE. SWATs return fire, shots sparking off the concrete walls, then BOOM behind him the tunnel ERUPTS IN FIRE, blasting the sWATs. Gordon races forward, tearing through the tunnels. Blake jumps back as a fireball bursts out of the manhole. Gordon races around a corner, gun drawn. A noise makes him turn WHACK, he is clobbered from behind by a Thug. Blake pushes forward. Come on, we gotta get down there That was a gas explosion, kid Gas? This is a sewer! No one goes in there till we know whats down there. We know whats down there, sir. The Police Commissioner! Somebody get the hothead out of here. And get me a DWP guy! Blake backs off. Gets an idea goes for his patrol car. Thug flips Gordon onto his back. This ones alive. Looks closer. Jesus. Its the Police Commissioner What do we do? Take him to Bane. The two Thugs drag Gordon down through the maze of tunnels. As they descend deeper they encounter work crews of muscular men wielding large drills and jackhammers, working the walls and ceiling of the larger tunnels. Some of the men are armed Mercenaries, overseeing gangs of homeless street kids. They stare as Gordon is dragged past. The Thugs drag Gordon between two waterfalls, into They approach a figure, turned away, crouched in the firelight. Barechested, muscular, masked. Bane. A crooked line of scar tissue runs the length of his spine... Why are you here? The Thugs drop Gordon at Banes feet. Answer him! Bane slowly turns to the Thugs. Im asking you. Its the Police Commissioner. And you brought him down here? We didnt know what to do. We You panicked. And your weakness costs three lives. No, hes alone Bane flips the Thugs chin up and to the side with a crack. Thug drops Bane turns to Thug Search him. Then I will kill you. The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordons badge, wallet, gun and the folded papers of the speech he did not read. Bane takes these one by one with quick glances. He'stops at the papers. Unfolds them... As he reads, Gordon rolls off the steps, dropping into the rushing flow of water gunshots ring out. He's dead. Thug trails off as Bane looks up from the papers... Then show me his body. That water runs to any one of the outflows wed never find him. Bane turns to the Lead Mercenary. Give me your GPS. Lead Mercenary hands him a GPS Bane tucks it into Thug s jacket, zips it up like a mother sending her kid to school. Follow him. Follow him? Bane shoots Thug kicks him into the water. Turns to Lead Mercenary Track him. Make sure both bodies will not be found. Then brick up the south tunnel Blake comes out to the catchment basin. He'spots something stuck up against the grille, thrusts his hand into the raging waters Gordon is there, alive. Just. Blake pulls him up onto the concrete, hoists him up, hurrying... Alfred opens the door to reveal Blake in his dirty uniform. I need to see Brice Wayne. Im sorry, Mr. Wayne doesnt take unscheduled calls. Even from police officers And if I go get a warrant, in the investigation of Harvey Dents murder? Would that still count as unscheduled? Blake is sitting, drumming his leg, nervous. Wayne enters. What can I do for you, officer? Commissioner Gordons been shot. Im sorry to hear that He chased a gunman down into the sewers. When I pulled him out he was babbling about an underground army. A masked man called Bane Shouldnt you be telling this to your superior officers? I did. One of them asked if He'saw any giant alligators down there. He needs you. He needs the Batman. If Commissioner Gordon thinks Im the Batman he must be in a bad way He doesnt know or care who you are Off look. But weve met before. When I was a kid. At the orphanage. See, my mom died when I was small. Car accident, I dont really remember it. But a couple of years later my dad was shot over a gambling debt. I remember that just fine. Looks at Wayne. Not a lot of people who what it feels like, do they? To be angry. In your bones. People understand, foster parents understand. For a while. Then they expect the angry kid to do what he knows he can never do. To move on. To forget. Wayne stares at Blake. So they stopped understanding and sent the angry kid to a boys home St. Swithins. Used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. See, I figured it out too late. You have to hide the anger. Practice smiling in the mirror. Like putting on a mask. You showed up one day in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm. BLAKE contd We were so excited Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan. We made up stories about you. Legends. The other boys stories were just that. But when I saw you I knew who you really were... Beat. Id seen that look on your face. Same one I taught myself. Blake gets up to leave. Wayne is lost in thought. I dont know why you took the fall for Dents murder, but Im still a believer in the Batman. Even if you re not Why did you say your boys home used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation? Because the money stopped. Might be time to get some fresh air and start paying attention to the details. Some of those details might need your help. Wayne and Alfred watch Blake drive away. You checked that name? Bane Ran it through some databases. Hes a mercenary. No other known name. Never been seen or photographed without a mask. He and his men were behind a coup in West Africa that secured mining operations for our friend John Daggett. Now Daggetts brought them here? It would seem so. Ill keep digging Alfred turns to leave. Why did the Wayne Foundation stop funding boys homes in the city? The Foundation is funded from the profits of Wayne Enterprises... Off look. There have to be some. Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think. Ill get him on the phone No. Do we still have any cars around the place? lights up One or two. And I need an appointment at the hospital. About my leg. Which hospital, sir? Whichever one Jim Gordons in. Alfred is less excited by this part of the request. Moving towards the tall skyscraper downtown. Mr. Fox, I believe in what Mr. Wayne was trying to do. Miranda is talking to Lucius Fox at the table. Im only asking for explanations because I think I can help. Ill pass along your request. Next time I see him. Miranda catches something in this. He doesnt talk to you either? Lets just say that Bruce Wayne has his. .eccentricities. rising Mr. Fox, are you aware that John Daggett is trying to acquire shares in Wayne Enterprises? I was not. But it wouldnt do him any good Mr. Wayne still retains a clear majority. Miranda leaves. Fox moves into his office stops Bruce Wayne. As I live and breathe. Wayne rises, pushing hard on his cane. What brings you out of cryosleep Mr. Wayne? I see you havent lost your sense of humor... even if you have lost most of my money. Actually, you did that yourself. See, if you funnel the entire R and D budget for five years into a fusion project that you then mothball, your company is unlikely to thrive. Even with A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes. Wayne Enterprises is running out of time. And Daggett is moving in. What re my options? If youre not willing to turn your machine on I cant, Lucius. Then sit tight. Your majority keeps Daggett at arm s length while we figure out a future for the energy program with Miranda Tate shes supported your project all the way. Shes smart, and quite lovely. You too, Lucius? We all just want whats best for you, Bruce. Show her the machine. Ill think it over. Anything else? No, why? These conversations always used to end with some ... unusual requests. I retired. Let me show you some stuff, anyway. Fox hits a button the bookcase opens into a hidden elevator Fox leads Wayne into the vast, gadgetfilled space. They pass Tumblers with different weapons configurations... I figured youd have shut this place down. It was always shut down, officially But all this new stuff? After your father died, Wayne Enterprises set up fourteen different defense subsidiaries. Ive spent years shuttering them and consolidating all the prototypes under one roof. My roof. Why? Stop them falling into the wrong hands. Besides, I thought someone might get some use out of them. Wayne shakes his head. Sure I cant tempt you to something? Pneumatic crampons? Infrared lenses? Least let me get you something for that leg. Its fine the use it gets these days Well, then I have just the thing for an eccentric billionaire who doesnt like to walk... Fox opens a door we glimpse a sleek vehicle. Waynes eyes light up. Now youre just showing off. Defense Department project for t ightgeomet ry urban pacification. Rotors configured for maneuvering between buildings without recirculation Whats it called? It has a long and uninteresting Wayne Enterprises designation. So I took to calling it the Bat. And yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling. Works great except for the autopilot Whats wrong with that? Softwarebased instability. Take a better mind than mine to fix it. Better mind? I was trying to be modest. A less busy mind. Yours, perhaps. Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away. I told you. I retired, Lucius. Wayne listens, distracted, while a Doctor examines an Xray. Ive seen worse cartilage in knees That s good No, thats because there is no cartilage in your knee. And not much of any use in your elbows and shoulders. Between that and the scar tissue on your kidneys, residual concussive damage to your brain tissue and general scarredover quality of your body... Takes a deep breath. I cannot recommend that you go heliskiing. About the only part of your body that looks healthy is your liver, so if youre bored I recommend you take up drinking, Mr. Wayne Wayne smiles. The Doctor leaves. Wayne pulls on a ski mask, steps to the window, hops up, pulls a wire from his cane, which he clips to his belt. He props his cane behind the frame jumps out. The wire unspools from the cane as Wayne drops three floors... Gordon lies in his bed, hooked up to machines. Wayne, in sk mask, stands over him. Gordons eyes flutter open. He tries to speak with a weak, hoarse voice... We were in this together. Then you were gone The Batman wasnt needed anymore. We won. Built on a lie. Our lie. Now theres evil rising from where we tried to bury it. Nobody will listen... The Batman has to come back What if he doesnt exist anymore? He must He must Wayne pulls up in front of a row of shabby subdivided town houses. Checks a tracking device. Jon, provocatively dressed, leads a Yuppie Bankertype in through a front door. Selina sits in a small room getting ready to go out. She picks up the pearls hears a disturbance in the hall. I told you money first Goddammit, you took my wallet! The Yuppie has Jen against the wall he reaches back to hit her with an expensive wristwatchclad arm. But Selina has grabbed his wrist with a powerful grip. Get out She took my wallet! Selina twists his arm behind him in a blinding move. Now She releases the Yuppie, who moves off down the stairs. Selina turns to Jen. Who is examining a wallet. I told you not to try it with the assholes, Jen. Theyre all assholes. Okay, the assholes who hit. I dont know what hes so upset about, he only had sixty bucks in here Probably the watch. Watch? Selina opens her hand and gives Jen the Yuppies Rolex. Selina exits and hails a cab. Wayne watches her go. Then pulls out. Checking his tracker. Town cars dispense Gotham society in tasteful masquerade. Wayne pulls up to the Valet. Paparazzi line the entrance. Wayne uses his cane to get out of his Lamborghini... Another stiff too old to climb out of his sports car. No, thats Bruce Waynel Hey, Wayne, where you been hiding? Lenses swing onto Wayne, who pushes a button on his key fob a pulse. The cameras die. Wayne heads to the door. Im not sure if my assistant put me on the guest list Right through here, Mr. Wayne... A lavish ball the expressively attired dance under falling confetti... Even Bruce Wayne is struck by the ostentation. He'spots Selina dancing with a deeply smitten Rich Twit. She wears a small, velvet pair of cat ears. And the pearls. Bruce Wayne at a charity ball? Wayne turns to find Miranda Tate, amazed, a small mask her only concession to fancy dress. Miss Tate, isnt it? Even before you became a recluse, you never came to these things True. Proceeds go to the big fat spread, not the cause. Its not about charity, its about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid it on. Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne Oh And the proceeds will go where they should, because I paid for the big fat spread myself. Thats very generous of you. You have to invest to restore balance to the world. Take our cleanenergy project... Sometimes the investment doesnt pay off. Sorry. You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne. But a man who doesnt care about the world doesnt spend half his fortune on a plan to save it Gentle. And isnt so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding Wayne looks at Miranda. Intrigued. Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne. Wayne watches Miranda glide away. Then turns to Selina. Mind if I cut in? Rich Twit turns, annoyed Wayne hands him his cane. Takes Selina by the waist. She glares at him. You dont seem very happy to see me You were supposed to be a shutin. Felt like some fresh air. Why didnt you call the police? I have a powerful friend who deals with this kind of thing. Admires her cat ears. Brazen costume for a cat burglar. Yeah? Who are you pretending to be? Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. Whos your date? His wifes in Ibiza. She left her diamonds behind, though. Worried theyd get stolen. Its pronounced Ibeetha You wouldnt want these folks realizing youre a crook not a social climber flash of anger You think I care what anyone in this room thinks about me? I doubt you care what anyone in this room thinks about you. Dont condescend, Mr. Wayne. You dont know a thing about me. Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here from your walkup in Old Town modest place for a master jewel thief. Which means either youre saving for your retirement or youre in deep with the wrong people You dont get to judge me because you were born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor. Actually, I was born in the Regency Room I started off doing what I had to. Once youve done what you had to they never let you do what you want to. Start fresh. Theres no fresh start in todays world. Any twelveyearold with a cell phone could find out what you did. Everything we do is collated and quantified. Everything sticks. We are the sum of our mistakes. Or our achievements. The mistakes stick better. Trust me You think that justifies stealing? I take what I need to from those who have more than enough. I dont stand on the shoulders of people with less. Robin Hood? Id do more to help someone than most of the people in this room. Than you. Maybe youre assuming too much. Or maybe youre being unrealistic about whats really in your pants other than your wallet. Ouch You think all this can last? Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party. Theres a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits youre all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little to the rest of us. Sounds like youre looking forward to it Im adaptable. These pearls do look better on you then they did in my safe... Wayne rolls her into his shoulder reaches up to the back of her neck, unclasps the necklace. But I still cant let you keep them The pearls slide off her neck into his other hand. Selina looks at him. Angry. Then kisses him, hard, and disappears into the crowd. Waynes cane reappears. annoyed You scared her off. Not likely. Wayne approaches the Valet. Pats down his pockets. I must have lost my ticket Your wife said you were taking a cab home, sir. My wife Selina permits herself a little smile as she guns the engine Alfred watches in the mirror as Wayne climbs into the back. Just you, sir? Wayne gives him a withering glare. ALFRED contd Dont worry. Master Wayne. Takes a little time to get back into the swing of things. Wayne dials his phone. This is Fox. Remember those unusual requests I used to make? I knew it Up front, Alfred listens. Concerned. Wayne pushes a button on a hitech carbon fiber brace strapped to his good knee the brace tones. As Wayne starts moving his knee, bending, stretching, Alfred puts down a Thermos Youve got the wrong leg, sir. You start with the good limb so it learns your optimum muscle patterns Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. Puts his weight on it the knee bends, kicks. He'sits again. Cautious. Now we tighten it up. Wayne gingerly pushes a button the brace starts to shrink tight to his leg, digging in. Wayne grits his teeth. It is terribly painful? gritted teeth Youre welcome to try it, Alfred. Happy watching, thank you, sir. Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. He gets to his feet. Not bad Wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick. Not bad at all. Alfred picks up the brick. Considers it. Uneasy. He follows Wayne across the bridge to the cube. Master Wayne, if youre considering going back out there you need to hear some rumors surrounding Bane. Im all ears. There is a prison. In a more ancient part of the world. A pit. Where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes, a man rises from the darkness. Somet imes the pit sends something back. Bane Born and raised in a hell on earth. Born in a prison? No one knows why. Or how he escaped. But they know who trained him one he did...Ras al Ghul Your mentor Wayne takes this in. Shocked. He plucked Bane from a dark corner of the earth and trained him in the blackest disciplines of combat, deception and endurance. Just like you Bane was a member of the League of Shadows Until he was excommunicated. And a man considered too extreme for Ra s al Ghul is not to be trifled with. I didnt realize I was known for trifling with criminals. That was then. And you can strap up your leg and put the mask back on. But it wont make you what you were Which was? Someone whose anger at death made him value all life. Even his own. If this man is all the things you say he is, then this city needs me. The Batsuit emerges from the cube. Yes, this city needs Bruce Wayne. Your resources, your knowledge ... not your body. Not your life. That time has passed. I tried helping as Bruce Wayne, Alfred. And I failed. You can fail as Bruce Wayne. As Batman, you cant afford to. Thats what youre afraid of that if I go back out there Ill fail. No. Im afraid that you want to. Wayne looks at Alfred. Then turns to examine the Batsuit. A frenzy of trading on the packed floor... Two Traders sit on a shoe shine stand in the lobby. You cant short the stock because Bruce Wayne goes to a party Wayne coming back is change. Change is either good or bad. On what basis? I flipped a coin. Near the front entrance a Food Delivery Guy is standing there negotiating with a Trader. No. Rye. I told em rye. Trader spots bad news on a screen. Alright, Ill take it. He thrusts Food Guy a tip and grabs the bag, distracted. At the rear secure entrance a Motorcycle Courier enters, wearing his helmet a Female Security Guard gets in his face Rookie! Lose the helmet! Points at a camera. We need faces for cameras In the rest room a Janitor mops the floor, shifting out of the way of two Traders who rush in to pee. At the shoe shine stand. Trader waves a bill down at the man shining his shoes without a glance. Shoeshine Man takes the bill, then, as the Traders step off, he reaches into a gym bag and checks an automatic weapon. He clicks the slide home, then hoists the gym bag and heads for the trading floor At the secure entrance the Courier pulls off his helmet. The Female Security Guards eyes go wide. In the rest room the Janitor reaches into his bucket and pulls out a machine pistol in a Ziploc bag. Near the front entrance Food Guy pulls an automatic pistol clubs Trader with it, pastrami flying. Shoeshine Man moves onto the floor, pulls out his weapon. Under the Couriers helmet a mask. Bane. He grabs the Female Security Guard and throws her into her colleagues, lashing out in four directions with rapidfire lethality. Shoeshine Man fires into the large trading screens. The floor erupts into a different frenzy traders hit the deck screaming. Bane moves onto the floor... This is a stock exchange, theres no money you can steal He dries up as Bane stops. Turns to him... Why else would you people be here? Bane grabs Trader by the throat and drags him across the floor to an online automated trades terminal... He puts the mans thumb onto the print reader the screen lights up. Enter your password. Or I send these men to your home. Trader terrified, types in his password. Outside, sirens Shoeshine man pulls out a USB drive with an antenna plugs it into the computer figures race across the screen... Police vehicles screech into the narrow street construction vehicles are blocking. Blake argues with a burly Construction Worker. Move it, now! Weve got a situation Where can I move it?! That way Blake points but SWAT vehicles pile in, blocking. Get in your vehicle and stay there! Foley and the sWAT Commander, Allen, approach the entrance. The Market Security Chief walks up, frantic. Youve gotta get in there! This is a hostage situation Its a robbery! Theyve got direct access to the online trading desk. Im not risking my men for your money Its not our money, its everyone s Really? Mines in my mattress. If you dont shut these guys down, the stuffing in that mattress might be worth a whole lot less, pal. Cut the fiber line shut down the cell tower. Thatll slow them down. Shoeshine Man looks up from the laptop. They cut the fiber. Cells working. For now. How much longer does the program need? Eight minutes. Time to go mobile. Shoeshine Man picks up the laptop, slips it into his pack.. Allen shouts at his men. Get the barriers up no more in and out on this street! Steel wedgeshaped barriers rise up at the mouth of the street. A Sniper watches the doors through a thermal scope. Six large heat signatures bloom, too big for people... Ive got something The door explodes. SWATs duck, six sportbikes race out and leap the ramplike barricades, sending SWATs scattering. Cops scramble to pull their vehicles out to give chase. The bikes weave through traffic. Traders strapped to the back, facing backwards screaming, ties flying in the wind A cruiser falls in behind. Shoot the tires! A Veteran Cop sights a shot, but the Traders are in the way No shot Foley is barking into his radio. Back off, back off! Theyve got hostages The cruiser follows the bike into a large tunnel. A Rookie Cop looks up into his rearview. Whats going on with the lights? The Veteran Cop looks back streetlights and headlights are dying one after another. The darkness is chasing them the darkness hits them. Their lights, sirens, and engine die... And, out of the silence, a dark shape roars past It can t be The hell was that?! Oh boy. Youre in for a show tonight, son. Food Guy drives the rear bike. He looks back sees streetlights explode behind him darkness catching him up. The engine chokes and dies. The Trader jumps off, shouting for the cops. Food Guy turns, pulling his gun. SMASH! Food Guy is thrown backwards off his bike by a dark wing as BATMAN races by on the BatPod. Foley rushes to Blakes cruiser. Lets roll, theyve spotted the Batman The remaining bikes split up as they reach a high overpass. Batman pulls up, overlooking the intersection pulls a rifleshaped device. A tone builds he aims it at the bike and fires. Janitors bike sparks and dies. Sirens as Cops move in. Another bike splutters and dies the Hostage breaks for cover Batman sees the last two bikes disappear beneath an overpass. He holsters his EMP rifle and guns the BatPod. Foley, in the back, is using the cruiser as a mobile command station into radio Call everyone in every car patrol, beat cop, offduty, too! Pull em in, close every street! Now Foley looks out at Gotham rushing by. Im gonna do what Gordon never could What s that? Im gonna take down the Batman. Sir, what about the armed robbers? Foley ignores him. All around the city, cops mobilize cars, vans, choppers... Bane pulls up at speed alongside Shoeshine Man. Shoeshine Man glances inside his pack signals Bane turns, sees darkness approaching, reaches back and grabs his Hostage, lifting him onto the back of Shoeshine Mans bike. Bane peels off Batman stays on Shoeshine Man. A Spotter watches Bane peel off, hits the radio. into radio One bikes pulled off, no hostage Foley listens to the radio, hungry over radio Should we pursue? Negative! Stay on the Batman! But hes getting away! annoyed Who do you want to catch? Some robber, or the sonofabitch who killed Harvey Dent? Coverage of the pursuit blares from all the TVs, as Daggett and Stryver watch. Tense. People arent saying much frankly, theyre too busy but all signs suggest that what were TV ANNOUNCER contd seeing is, in fact, the return of the Batman Moving in on a shadow, crouched in front of Daggetts safe, working the dial... The shadow slides up a pair of goggles onto the top of its head creating the silhouette of cat ears. It is Catwoman. She turns to the TV, watching the pursuit Well, what do you know? Catwoman opens the safe. Nothing inside. She frowns. Bane slips between two cruisers who tear after the Batman. He jumps up onto a concrete barrier, then down to the mouth of an outflow pipe. He glances at the entire Gotham Police Department descending on one man. Disappears into the pipe. Shoeshine Man glances into his pack the program beeps, finished. He looks back to see the BatPod racing at him, ducks as it comes alongside ... riderless Shoeshine Man looks up, confused. WHUMP His hostage is ripped off the bike by a lowflying dark shape. Shoeshine Man lays down the bike in a shower of sparks, rolls off dazed. Batman grabs him. Shoeshine Man stares. Unafraid. Batman rips the computer from his pack. The screen reads Blinding light and noise as police choppers descend sirens everywhere. Batman grabs the USB drive from the laptop. He jumps on the BatPod pauses, taking in the sight of thousands of police, cars, choppers, dogs, closing in. over loudspeaker Batman looks at the line of stopped traffic. An empty car transporter is below the onramp... Batman fires the cannons at the transporter, the near ramp crashes down, and Batman roars towards it mounts it and jumps onto the onramp. Daggett angrily grabs some ice cubes for his drink. After eight years he has to pick tonight Hes drawing the cops off Bane... Daggett watches, intrigued. Foley shouts down the phone. How did you let him go?! over radio Hes got a lot of firepower And you dont?! Were not letting one nut with a bad attitude and some fancy gadgets run this town down, you hear me?! over radio Hes heading back downtown... excited Then hes as dumb as he dresses close it down, gentlemen! Thousands of police jockey to pursue the Batman as he races back into the downtown area. The BatPod tears along, pursued by a phalanx of cruisers, choppers overhead. More cops appear at the far end of the boulevard The BatPod executes a ninetydegree turn, flipping over as it goes, then guns into the darkness of a large blind alley. Cruisers and choppers block the mouth of the alley. Blake arrives last, his cruiser sealing the bottleneck. Foley swaggers out Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen. Foley reaches for a loudhailer. VARRROOOOM!! A noise from the alley that none of the cops have heard before... You might have the wrong animal there, sir Spotlights smash on and a massive dark cyclone roars out of the alley, spinning the choppers sideways, dual rotor downdraft forcing all the cops to the ground. The Bat, now black, thunders up and over the entire Gotham PD. Blake slides up to Foley. Dry. Are you sure that was him? Foley looks at Blake. Thrusts the loudhailer at him. Gordon, still hooked up to machines, watches TV. He'smiles. on TV Police are keeping quiet about the prospect of a return by the Batman, but eyewitness accounts seem the clearly suggests the type of... Daggett watches the TV coverage, concerned. Stryver enters. Bane says the Batman interfered, but the task was accomplished. What about the men they arrested? He'says, and I quote, they would die before talking. grins Where does he find these guys? Daggett gets to his feet, relieved, moves to his inner office Open the champagne... Daggett comes through the door, calling back. And can we get some girls in here? Careful what you wish for. Catwoman grabs him, throws him across the room. His back slams against the wall he draws a gun, but WHACK! Catwoman pins his wrist to the wall at shoulder height using the high heel of her boot. He whimpers as she leans in. Cat got your tongue? She plucks the gun from his trembling hand. You dumb bitch. Nobody ever accused me of being dumb Dumb to show up here tonight I want what you owe me Click Stryver has a gun to her head. I want never gets Stryver looks appreciatively at Catwoman as she lowers her leg Nice out fit ... those heels make it tough to walk? Catwoman digs her stiletto into his calf, hard. He'screams. I dont know, do they? Catwoman spins, disarms Stryver, grabs Daggett. So where is it? Wheres what? The program. The Clean Slate. Oh, yeah the ultimate tool for a master thief with a record. I dont have it The Bodyguard bursts in, gun drawn. Catwoman, holding Daggett, spins, kicking the window with the point of her heel. The glass shatters. She pulls Daggett through the window. He'screams they drop. ...ten feet onto the windowcleaning platform. Catwoman uses her bladed heel to cut a rope the platform plunges down the side of the building. Catwoman dumps Daggett onto the roof, towering over him. Where is it? The Clean Slate? Type in a name and date of birth and within a couple hours that person ceases to exist in any database? Little too good to be true. Youre lying. Rykin Data took it to prototype stage Thats why I bought them. But they had nothing It was a gangland myth Catwoman leans back from Daggett, taking this in... Shapes drop onto the rooftop. Emerge from fire exits. Theyre not Daggetts bodyguards, these are Banes men... Catwoman holds Daggett by the throat, threatening him. Stay back! They continue to approach. One of them screws a silencer onto his gun. Im not bluffing! They know. All eyes search for the source of the voice. Catwoman spots it a dark shape, crouched on the roof above Batman. They just dont care. As the Mercenary with the silencer looks up, Catwoman leaps forward, grabs his gun. Batman drops into the middle of the fray, fighting back Mercenaries at Catwoman s back she fires at one, clipping him, he drops. SHe'spins aiming at another s head Batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to miss the Mercenary. Batman takes him out with a kick. Youve got to be kidding. No guns. No killing. Wheres the fun in that? As more mercenaries come out onto the roof. Batman runs for the far edge. Come on Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof. She gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley sees the black angular roof of the Bat, cockpit open. Shots impact around her she leaps, landing hard, but gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the cockpit. As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy hisses shut, taking bullets from above. My mother warned me about getting into cars with strange men This isnt a car. Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky, downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against the wind... Bane. He watches the Bat roar off into the night. The Bat lands the canopy opens. Catwoman jumps out. See you around Batman steps down after her. Youre welcome. I had it under control. Those werent street thugs they were trained killers. I saved your life. In return I need to know what you did with Bruce Waynes fingerprints Catwoman looks at him. Considering. Wayne wasnt kidding about a powerful friend. I sold his prints to Daggett. For something that doesnt even exist. I doubt many people get the better of you. Hey, when a girls desperate... What were they going to do with them? I dont know. But Daggett seemed pretty interested in that mess at the stock market Batman considers this. A police chopper sweeps past, searching. Batman turns to it. Then turns back. Miss Kyle But she is gone. So thats what that feels like. Alfred is studying security camera footage of Bane killing at the stock exchange. A roar builds the waterfall glows brighter until ... SMASH The Bat breaches, downdraft spraying water. Two cubes rise the Bat lands. Batman jumps out. Alfred brushes water off his suit. Very inconspicuous. Shall I tell the neighbors you got yourself a new leafblower? We bought all the neighbors. Alfred takes the cowl from him, then the cape, as they walk. From the look of the television coverage, you seem to have your taste for wanton destruction back. pulls out USB drive I retrieved this. Shouldnt the police be gathering the evidence? They dont have the tools to analyze it. They would if you gave them to them One man s tool is another man s weapon In your mind, perhaps. But there arent many things you couldnt turn into a weapon. Alfred. Enough. The police werent getting it done Perhaps they wouldve if you havent made a sideshow of yourself Perhaps youre upset you were wrong Wrong? You thought I didnt have it in me. Alfred looks at him. Puts down the cape and cowl. You dont. You lead a bloated police force on a merry chase with some fancy new toys from Fox. What about when you come up against him. What then? Alfred points to the monitor Wayne sees Bane killing. Ill fight harder, I always have. When you had something to fight for. What are you fighting for now? Not your life. Wayne moves to switch off the monitor. Alfred grabs his hand Take a good look. At his speed, his ferocity. His training. I see the power of belief. Of the fanatic. I see the League of Shadows resurgent You said he was excommunicated. By Ra s al Ghul Who leads them now? Ra s al Ghul was the League of Shadows. And I beat him. Banes just a mercenary, and we have to find out what hes up to. Wayne plugs the USB in, hits keys. Text scrolls. Trades of some kind. Coded. The screen blanks, a thumb print appears. Is that Mine. Courtesy of Selina Kyle. Wayne pulls out the USB, rises. Get this to Fox he can crack the code and tell us what trades they were executing. Alfred looks at Wayne. Takes the USB. As Wayne hits the bottom of the stairs, Alfred calls. Ill get this to Fox. But no more. Waynne hears his tone of voice. Turns to him. Ive sewn you up and set your bones... but I wont bury you. Ive buried enough members of the Wayne family Youd abandon me? You see only one end to your story. Leaving is all I have to make you understand you arent Batman anymore you have to find another way. You used to talk about finishing. About life beyond that awful cave Rachel died knowing wed decided to be together. That was my life beyond this cave and I cant just move on. She didnt. She couldnt. Alfred considers this. Looks away. What if he had? What if she wasnt intending to make a life with you? She was, I cant change that What if, before she died, shed written a letter? Explaining that shed chosen Harvey Dent over you? Wayne watches, confused, as the old man prepares to say And what if, to spare you pain... Id burned that letter? Wayne stares at Alfred, shocked. Why would you say such a thing? Because I have to make you understand You re lying Because you are as precious to me as you were to your own mother and father and I swore to them that I would protect you and I havent. Youre lying Ive never lied to you. Except when I burned Rachels letter. Wayne turns on the old man, furious. How dare you use Rachel to stop me! Im using the truth. Master Wayne. Maybe its time we all stopped trying to outsmart the truth and just let it have its day. Im sorry Sorry? You expect to destroy my world, then shake hands?! No. I know what this means What does it mean, Alfred? It means your hatred. It means losing the person Ive cared for ever since I heard his first cries echo through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important. Wayne looks at Alfred. Furious. Summons the worst thing to say and says it quietly and calmly. Goodbye, Alfred. quiet Goodbye, Bruce. Wayne mounts the stairs .. .Alfred watches him go. Turns. Wayne is woken by the doorbell. As Wayne moves through the empty house, tying his dressing gown, he cant resist one tentative. Alfred? But Alfred is gone. Wayne opens the front door the find Fox. Fox is surprised. Answering your own door? Yes. Could you decode the trades on that drive? Fox hands Wayne a newspaper the main headline I didnt need to. Page three. Wayne turns the page It seems you made a series of large put options on the futures exchange. Verified by thumb print. The options expired at midnight last night. Wayne looks up from the newspaper, reeling. Long term we may be able to prove fraud, but for now... you re completely broke. And Wayne Enterprises is about to fall into the hands of John Daggett. The weapons we cant let Daggett get his hands on Applied Sciences Applied Sciences is shut up tight, and off the books. The energy project is a different story. Miranda Tate. We need to convince the board to get behind her. Lets show her the reactor Were meeting her there in thirtyfive minutes. You better get dressed A scrapyard on the Gotham river. Across the water, the towers of Gotham. Lucius leads Miranda from her car. You brought me out here to show me a rubbish dump, Mr. Fox? Bear with me. Miss Tate. They arrive at a Portakabin and enter. Miranda looks around the derelict office. Fox smiles at her. Keep your hands and feet inside the car at all times. He hits a button and the floor descends, Miranda is shocked as the office becomes an elevator into They descend diagonally into a massive concrete tunnel... This is it, isnt it? The reactor is beneath the river so that it could be instantly flooded in an event of a security breach. Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid? Im gonna plead the fifth on that one Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. SHe'spots a figure deep within Bruce Wayne. I thought you might like to see what your investment built. No radiation, no fossil fuels. Free, clean energy for an entire city If it worked. It doesnt. Wayne leads Miranda to the core. Two perpendicular rings of electromagnets suspend a bowlingballsized mass of metal. Wayne hits buttons the ball glows, then dies to cold. Ignition, yes. But no chain reaction Youve built a lot of security around a damp squib. Nothing About three years ago a Russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions. One week later your reactor started developing problems... Looks at Wayne. I think this machine works. Miranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too great Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist died in a plane crash six months ago? Someone else will work out what Dr. Pavel did. Someone else will figure out how to turn this power source into a nuclear weapon. I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor. And to do what with it? Nothing. Until we can find a way to guarantee its safety. And if we cant? Decommission it. Flood it. Destroy the world s best chance for a sustainable future? If the worlds not ready. Yes. Bruce, if you want to save the world you have to start trusting it Im trusting you. Doesnt count. You have no choice. I couldve flooded this chamber any time in the last three years. Im choosing to trust you, Miranda, and thats not the easiest thing for me. Please. His eyes are genuine. Pleading. Miranda nods. We have a board meeting to get to. The Board Members, including Daggett and Miranda, take thei seats. Fox at one end of the table, Wayne at the other. Id like to point out that we have a nonboard member here. Highly irregular, even if it is his family name above the door. All eyes go to Wayne. An older member of the board pipes up Bruce Waynes family built this company And he himself has run it Into the ground, sir. Anybody disagree? Check the value of your shares this morning. Gambling on crazy futures didnt just lose Mr. Wayne his seat, its lost us all a lot of money. He needs to leave. Im afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne I understand. Ladies and gentlemen. Wayne glances at Miranda who nods at him. Wayne leaves. Lets get down to business. Right away. Wayne exits the building. There is an angry mob of Shareholders and a pack of hungry Reporters. Wayne, hows it feel to be one of the people? Im sorry, sir, they had paperwork Wayne looks over to see his Lamborghini being towed. Looks like you need a lift. Wayne turns to see Blake standing by his patrol car. Nods. Daggett bursts in, furious. Stryver tries to placate him. How the hell did Miranda Tate get the inside track on the Wayne board?! Was she meeting with Wayne? Was sHe'sleeping with Wayne? Not that we know of Clearly you dont know of anything, do you?! Wheres Bane?! We told him it was urgent Then where is the masked Speak of the devil... Daggett turns. Bane is already there. ...and He'shall appear. What the hells going on? The plan is proceeding as expected. You see me running Wayne Enterprises?! Moves towards Bane. Your stock exchange hit didnt work, friend. And now youve got my construction crews working all hours around the city? Hows that supposed to help my company absorb Wayne s to Stryver Leave us You stay right there! Im in charge Bane places a gentle hand on Daggetts shoulder. Do you feel in charge? Daggett is taken aback. Stryver leaves. Ive paid you a small fortune And that gives you power over me? Daggett considers the heavy hand on his shoulder. Nervous. What is this? Your money and infrastructure have been important. Till now. What are you? Gothams reckoning. Come to end the borrowed time youve all been iving on Bane gently takes the terrified Daggetts head in his hands You are true evil... I am necessary evil. Stryver, on the steps outside the living room, flinches. Wayne stares out the window. Blake glances across. When you began... why the mask? To protect the people closest to me Youre a loner with no family. There are always people you care about. You just dont realize how much until theyre gone. Collects himself The idea was to be a symbol. Batman could be anybody, that was the point. It was damn good to see him back. Not everybody agrees. Theyll figure it out in the end. Got anything on Banes whereabouts? Yeah, Ive got five hundred pages of tunnel records and a flashlight. I could use some help. thinks You know what? Drop me in Old Town Blake drops Wayne off. Dont wait. Ill get a cab. You got money? smiles, sheepish Actually, no. Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street. The radio squawks. Blake reacts drives off. Selina is packing a bag. She hears voices in the stairwell. I told you, money first. I dont think so. Selina finds Wayne standing there with Jen. He's not a mark Jen looks at Selina. At Wayne. And he doesnt have a cent to his name, anyway. Wayne looks at the cramped space. Selina shifts, embarrassed Yeah, its not much. Smiles. But its more that youve got right now Actually, theyre letting me keep the house. shakes head The rich dont even go broke same as the rest of us, huh? spots her bag Vacation? Lets just say that Ive incurred the wrath of some people less susceptible to my charms than you. My powerful friend hopes to change your mind about leaving. And how would he do that? By giving you what you want. It doesnt exist. He'says it does. He wants to meet. Tonight Why? He needs to find Bane. He thinks youd know how. Tell him Ill think about it. Wayne nods, starts to leave. Mr. Wayne? Im sorry they took all your money. No, youre not. Blake moves through the hospital corridor, looking for Blake enters. Gordon is sitting up in bed, talking to Foley. Can we help you, officer? John Daggetts body was found in a dumpster an hour ago. I thought you might like to know. Why? Because Daggetts name is all over the permits I pulled to map the tunnels under Gotham. Blake hands Gordon a stack of files. Foley glares at Blake. MTA maintenance, sewer construction. to Foley Where did you get to with the tunnel searches? to Blake Remind me to tell the detail to keep hotheads out. To Gordon. Weve had teams down there, but its a huge network Get more men, work a grid. I want him found. Yeah, yeah the masked man. Were on it Gordon eyes the files hungrily glances up at Blake. This is good work. Lose the uniform youre working for me now. We could use some hotter heads around here This could just be a coincidence. Youre a detective now, son, youre not allowed to believe in coincidence anymore. Blake tries to conceal his excitement from Foley. Wayne, covering his head with a newspaper, hurries up the driveway in the rain. Steps into the alcove. Hits the bell. Nobodys answering. Wayne turns to find Miranda there. No. Im on my own now. Do you have keys? Wayne looks a little helpless all of a sudden. Never needed them. She takes his hand. Lets find a window. They force the French windows enter, brushing off the rain Fox worked the board like youve never seen Im in, Daggetts out and hes not happy. Wayne sets down the newspaper Hope you dont like me for your money Miranda kicks off her shoes. Glances at the paper. Suffering builds character. Then at a photo of Waynes parents. Ill take care of your parents legacy, Bruce. Miranda picks up a photo of Rachel Who s this? Wayne looks at her. Cant find words... Wheres Alfred? He left. Taking everything. Miranda puts the photo down. Kisses him. Passionately, again. He kisses back. Suddenly the lights go out. What s that sheepish I think my powers been shut off. Wayne watches as Miranda tends to a roaring fire. Youre pretty good at that. When I was a child we had almost nothing. But on the nights we had a fire, we felt very rich indeed. Then She returns to him, pulling a blanket around both of them. I assumed your family was wealthy. Not always. Not when I was young. He traces a scar on her shoulder. An old mistake. Ive made a few myself. She turns to him, tracing the scars across his chest. More than a few... Smiles. We could leave. Tonight. Take my plane. Go anywhere we wanted. Someday perhaps Not tonight She pulls him close. He kisses her. They fold into each other, the warm heart at the center of a vast, cold room. Miranda is sleeping, wrapped in the blanket. Wayne studies her for a moment, then slips out... Wayne moves to the Batsuit. Picks up the cowl. The Bat roars towards downtown. Batman kills the lights and main engines the Bat quietly autorotates into the canyons. Catwoman on a wall, watching trains go by. SHe'senses... Dont be shy. ...Batman is there. Wayne says you can get me the Clean Slate That depends On what? On what you want it for. I acquired it to keep it out of the wrong hands Still dont trust me, huh? How can we change that? Start by taking me to Bane. shrugs You asked. Catwoman jumps down. Batman follows. Catwoman leads him down into a service tunnel Catwoman speaks over her shoulder as she walks. From here. Banes men patrol the tunnels ... and they are not your average brawlers Neither am I Catwoman swings into a A Mercenary patrols. Catwoman comes up behind. Hes behind you. spins Who? Batman hangs upside down behind him. Me Darkness smashes onto the Mercenary. Gunfire in the tunnel. Catwoman races along, pursued by a Mercenary. He is yanked off his feet by darkness He'screams... Batman picks off more and more Mercenaries. Screams echo... Batman follows Catwoman through the dark tunnel. Just a little further. A grate slams down, separating them the lights come on. He is deep inside. Mercenaries look down on him from above. Catwoman turns. I had to find a way to stop them trying to kill me. Youve made a serious mistake. Not as serious as yours, I fear. Batman turns. Bane emerges from behind the waterfalls. Bane Lets not stand on ceremony here, Mr Wayne Catwoman hears the name. Less sure of what shes done. Batman moves at Bane strikes powerful blows Bane catches his fist. Peace has cost you strength. Victory has defeated you. Bane SMASHES Batman back kicks him off the catwalk Batman drops, uses his cape to land. Bane climbs down on a chain his men watch in disciplined silence Batman hurls flashbangs at Bane, who doesnt flinch. Theatricality and deception are powerful agents... to the uninitiated Batman lashes out at Bane Bane counters they separate. But we are initiated, arent we, Bruce? The League of Shadows. And you betrayed us... Us? You were excommunicated. From a gang of psychopaths. Now I am the Legue of Shadows, here to fulfill Ra s al Ghuls destiny Batman hurls himself at bane, throwing his into the waterfall, where He'smashes his fists and gauntlets into Banes mask again and again, water cascading over them. Bane is not moving. Just taking the blows. Batman pauses. Banes arms SHOOT OUT, SMASHING Batman aside Bane RISES... You fight like a younger man. Nothing held back. No reserves. Admirable. But mistaken. Batman hits a switch on his belt the lights go out Bane turns slowly addressing all the shadows at once. You think darkness is your ally. But you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it Formed by it In the shadows. Batman circles, looking to strike... I didnt see the light until I was already a man. And by then it was nothing to me but blinding Bane lunges backwards into the darkness Batman s throat in his grasp. The shadows betray you, because they belong to me. Bane SMASHES him into the ground, POUNDING, pounding, pounding the hard cowl with his bare fists until it CRACKS. Bane RISES from Batman, gestures to the ceiling of the chamber explosive charges have been drilled into holes... I will show you where Ive made my home while preparing to bring justice. Then... I will break you. A Mercenary tosses Bane a detonator Batman watches through cracked cowl Bane hits the detonator explosions BURST over his head as the ceiling CRUMBLES revealing Applied Sciences Bane has dropped the bottom out of Foxs weapons store... a camouflage Tumbler rests in the rubble. No Your precious armory. Gratefully accepted. We will need it. Mercenaries race through the stacks of equipment... Batman climbs to his feet, swaying. Bane approaches. I wondered which would break first your spirit Batman SWINGS at him misses Bane GRABS him, lifts him ... or your body. Bane brings Batman down onto his knee, BREAKING his back with a horrific CRACK. In the shadows, Catwoman looks on. Shocked. Bane crouches to pull the broken cowl off the broken Wayne. Mercenaries lift Waynes body and carry him off... Bane stares into the hollow eyes of his trophy... Catwoman slinks back into the shadows, and we Blakes cruiser pulls up. He noses up to the windows. Nothing Blake sits in his cruiser. Selina exits, widebrimmed hat, bags. Blake recognizes her. She hails a cab. into radio Get Commissioner Gordon. Tell him Ive got a line on the Congressmans kidnapping. Blake pulls out to follow. Selina moves through the terminal. She clocks a Uniform Cop staring at her ducks down a service hallway. The Uniform rounds the corner to find Selina applying makeup Excuse me. Miss. I need to see your ticket and identification, please. Selina, surprised, fumbles with her purse. Would you mind? She hands the Uniform her had punches him through the brim, stuffs him in a closet plants her mangled hat on his head Selina makes her way down the jetway spots Security at the far end turns Blake smiles at her. Badge in hand. Selina, now in cuffs, looks up as Blake walks in. I showed your picture to the Congressman and guess what? Dont tell me, still in love? Head over heels. Pressing charges, though Blake lays a police file down with a thump. Youve made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle Girls gonna eat. You have an appetite. Why run? You cant hide from us with this record Maybe its not you Im running from Who then? Bane? What do you know about him? quiet That you should be as afraid of him as I am. We can offer you protection... Selina looks at him with contempt. Blake shrugs, switches off the tape, moves to the door. When I spotted you, I was looking for a f riend ... Bruce Wayne. Selina turns to look at Blake. His eyes plead with her. Did the kill him? Im not sure. And we BLACK SCREEN. Sounds screaming, laughing, CRYING. Sights LIGHT, bodies FALLING, a DARK SKULL... And we are Wayne opens his eyes. Unshaven. Filthy. Someone else is in the cell Wayne cannot move to look even the attempt is painful ... the skull drifts into his sight. Bane. Squatting at Waynes bedside, muscled shoulders curving into his mask Why didnt you just kill me? You dont fear death. You welcome it. Your punishment is to be more severe scathing Youre a torturer... Yes. But not of your body. Of your soul Wayne exhales. Eyes losing focus from sheer pain. Where am I? Home Waynes eyes dart about filthy stone walls, distant sunlight from above, iron bars an underground prison. Where I learned the truth about despair. As will you. Rises. There is a reason that this prison is the worst hell on earth... Bane steps to the bars looks up at a bright opening five hundred feet above. Like being at the bottom of a gigantic well Hope. Every man who has rotted here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So simple. So easy. And, like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. I learned that there can be no true despair without hope. Turns to Wayne. So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe they can survive so that you can watch them clamber over each other to stay in the sun. Bane points to an old TV, just outside the bars. You will watch as I torture an entire city to cause you pain you thought you could never feel again. Then, when you have truly understood the depths of your failure, we will fulfill Ra s al Ghuls destiny. We will destroy Gotham. And when it is done... when Gotham is ashes... then you have my permission to die. Bane rises. Leaves. Wayne drifts back to unconsciousness. A van pulls through the gate. Selina, inside the van, looks up at the formidable grey building. Guards lead Selina down the cells. Whistles and catcalls. Were locking her up in here? The Dent Act allows nonsegregation based on extraordinary need. First time she broke out of women s correctional she was sixteen. Selina passes a Huge Inmate who strains through the bars... Little closer, baby... Why, honey, you wanna hold my hand? Without breaking step, sHe'slips his outstretched hands between her handcuffed ones and cartwheels, snapping his arms He'screams in agony she keeps walking... Shell be just fine. Fox comes out of the elevator with Miranda. I dont see the need for a board meeting on the energy project Bruce got a lot of things right. Keeping the board in the dark wasnt one of them... Fox swings the doors to the boardroom open... The board is there. Scared. At the head of the table Bane. This meeting is called to order. Fox and Miranda freeze. Staring at the mask. Chair and President. I also need one ordinary member Mr. Fox, would you care to nominate? No. I volunteer. The dignified older board member gets to his feet. Mercernaries round the three up. Where are you taking us? Where you buried your resources. The bowels of Gotham. Gordon, with a Nurses help, pulls himself to a seated position as Blake watches. So you think our friend is gone again? grave This time... he might not be coming back Gordon takes this in... Foley bursts in, agitated. Okay, Commissioner, you were tight. Whats happened? Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne Enterprises board. He let most of them go, but took three down into the sewers No more patrols, no more hide and seek. Send every available cop down there to smoke him out. The Mayor wont want panic So its a training exercise. Foley looks at Gordon. Im sorry for not taking you seriously Dont apologize for believing the world s in better shape then it is... just fight to make it true. Foley nods. Leaves. Blake gets up. Not you. Youre telling me the Batmans gone. So you chase up the Daggett leads, any way you can. Blake nods. Wayne lies, weak, feverish. A Prisoner drips water onto his parched lips. An elderly Blind Prisoner squatting by the wall in the next cell rasps something in an ancient tongue. He asks if you would pay us to let you die. I told him you have nothing Do it for the pleasure. The Prisoner puts bread to Waynes lips. They pay me more than that to keep you alive. A chant gets Waynes attention. He rolls his head painfully to watch a Tattooed Prisoner hand a thick rope to a Strong Man, who ties it around his chest, watched by other Prisoners He will try the climb. String Man starts scaling the wall. The Prisoners chant grows stronger as he climbs towards the light. Above Strong Man stops, perched on a ledge, a twelvefoot leap from the rest of the climb... The chanting peaks as Strong Man leaps .. .misses ... falls The rope catches He'swings into the rock face. Prisoners fall silent as Strong Man is lowered, broken, bloody, to the prison floor. Has anyone made it? Of course not The Blind Prisoner barks at him. What does He'say? He'says there is one who did. A child. INSERT CUT a child of about ten looks up towards the light. A child who had been born in this hell Bane An old legend. Nothing more. The Prisoner leaves Waynes cell switches on the TV. Don t Whatever they want you to see... its happening soon. Banes men lead Fox, Miranda and Fredericks through the debris. Fox stares at Mercenaries working on his old inventions SWATs and Cops mass around entrances to sewers, tunnels... Bane leads Fox and the others to where Mercenaries plant charges on a hewn wall. Dr. Pavel is here. Waiting. Bane nods at his men. The wall blows. A SWAT team about to enter a sewer pipe hear a low echoing boom. They look at each other, then head in. Thousands of Police head into manholes, tunnel entrances, checking weapons, using flashlights... Bane leads the way over rubble into the REACTOR. Dr. Pavel follows. Bane approaches the machine. Turns to Fox. Turn it on. Fox shakes his head. Bane holds his gun to Fredericks head. I only need one other board member. There are eight more waiting upstairs I wont do it. Fredericks trembles. Bane cocks the weapon. Alright, stop. She walks up to the scanner. Places her hand on it. It beeps. She turns to Fox. Quietly pleading. Lucius, youll kill this man and yourself, and barely slow them down Fox reluctantly puts his hand on the scanner. Then Fredericks. The core glows brighter and brighter. Dr. Pavel is transfixed. Do your work. Bane turns to his men. Gestures at the hostages. Take them to the surface. People of their status deserve to see the next era of western civilization. Fox, Miranda and Fredericks are led back into the rubble. The Mayor, flanked by Security, talks to a crowd of Reporters Were seeing literally thousands of police heading into the sewers A training exercise, thats all. If youll excuse me, Ive got tickets to watch our boys thrash Rapid City The Mayor heads into the stadium with the crowds Hundreds of SWATs wade, flashlights swinging, heading towards the center... Teams are converging from different entry points Blake is on the phone. Ive been to half Daggetts cement plants, logged locations theyve poured for underground construction. Anything strange about the pourings Blake glances at a large map dots mark pouring locations. Honestly, Commissioner, I dont know anything about civil engineering But you know about patterns. Keep looking Blake pulls up in front of a cement plant. Dr. Pavel finishes his work. Turns to Bane. Grave. Its done. This is now a fourmegaton nuclear bomb. to his men Pull the core out of the reactor. horrified You cant. This is the only power source capable of sustaning it if you move it, the core will decay in a matter of months. Five, by my calculations. And then it will go off. For the sake of your family. Dr. Pavel, I hope so. Dr. Pavel stares as Mercenaries start to disconnect the core Blake is led through a fence by a Worker. Boss is about to leave. Blake walks past cement mixers. Spots someone. A Driver. Hey The Driver turns That was you outside the stock exchange, right? When? When? When half the citys cops were trying to pull onto Castle Street and your truck shut them out Oh yeah. Youre that cop Detective, now. Behind Blake the Worker puts his hand is his pocket... And as a detect ive ... I m not allowed to believe in coincidences anymore Blake spins, drawing his weapon. The Worker lunges with a knife, Blake smashes his hand to one side and shoots him. The Driver grabs him from behind. Blake wrestles, but the Driver is string, trained. Blake cant aim his gun, he fires behind, into a steel mixer the bullets ricochet, one catches the Driver in the back and he goes down... Blake, gasping, kneels beside the Driver. What were you doing?! What?! The man dies. Blake looks down at his gun. Disgusted. Tosses is down. Pulls out his phone. Dials. Commissioner, Im at the Fourteenth Street plant with two dead witnesses and a lot of questions. Call me Blake freezes, stooped to pick up his gun. Looking at some empty barrels. Commissioner, theyve got Polyisobutylene here... Looks around. And motor oil. They werent making cement, they were making explosives Blake grabs his carts scanning the pattern of the dots realizes Oh, God. Blake fires up the cruiser and pulls out, hard. Blake is driving furiously, shouting into the radio Patch me into Foley! over radio Foley s overseeing the operation Theyre heading into a trap! Foley, concerned, takes the radio from a colleague. Foley Its a trap! Pull everyone out! Banes been pouring concrete laced with explosives Where? Theres a ring around the tunnels theyre gonna blow it and trap the cops underground! Foley looks up with dread at the mouth of the tunnel Pull out! Pull em out! Mercenaries rise from a hole in the floor Bane emerges... The Mayor, in a corporate box, mouths the National Anthem. The Mercenaries pull out detonators. Bane listens to the kickoff like a hunting dog sensing the wind ... decides Let the games begin. The Mercenaries hit the detonators. SWATs react the tunnel roof behind collapses... Chunks of concrete structure drop thousands of police throughout different tunnels are trapped... The crowd goes wild as a Receiver catches starts a run the Mayor looks on, suddenly confused. As the Receiver sprints for the end zone, the field behind him DROPS away in smoking ruins, swallowing Players... The crowd is not cheering but SCREAMING... The Mayors box The Receiver, nearing the touchdown, glances back sees Armageddon the entire field is now a smoking mass of rubble, but for one strip of turf .. .Mercenaries pour out of the tunnel, creating a gauntlet... Blakes cruiser swerves to avoid eruptions of asphalt. An eruption TOSSES Blakes cruiser onto its roof. All bridges, except the Gotham Bridge, suffer controlled demolitions Bane steps into the smoking stadium, a gladiator walking into the arena... TV cameras swing onto him. Passing a dead umpire, he takes the mens headset surveys the screaming crowd, lifts an arm for silence, raises the mike to his mask Gotham, take control of your city Blake squeezes out of his cruiser, reaches in for the radio Foley? over radio Jesus, Blake! Every cop in the citys down in those tunnels! realizes Not every cop Blake pulls the shotgun from his cruiser flags down a car Gordons heartrate monitor alarms. Gordon wakes, groggy... Patients and Doctors crowd the entrance, mercenaries with automatic weapons force their way in hit the stairwell. Blake drives, swerving around dazed and terrified people. Flames and smoke billow from the sewers. Blake races up to the hospital entrance. Two Mercenaries move room to room, searching. Gordon pulls himself out of his bed, wheeling his IV. Blake jumps into the corridor, gun raised. Shots echo down the hall Blake sprints. Blake leaps into the room, gun high freezes as warm metal touches the base of his skull. Clear the corners, rookie. Blake turns. Gordon holds his service weapon. The Mercenaries are on the ground, dead. Get my coat, son. Mercenaries pull the glowing core onto the field. This is the instrument of your liberation Analysts and military personnel assess the situation. Satellite shows a radiation spike Whatever it is... its nuclear. The Mercenaries thrust Dr. Pavel to his knees before Bane. Identify yourself to the world. Dr. Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist Bane turns Dr. Pavels head for the cameras. Armed Forces and Intelligence staff scramble to verify. Pavel was confirmed dead plane crash on an Agency pullout of Uzbekistan... But it certainly looks like him He points to a monitor with a photo of Dr. Pavel. An Air Force General rubs his chin, thinking, nervous. Fs streak over the river, sizing up the island. Bane rests his powerful hand on Dr. Pavels shoulder Tell the world what this is. A fully primed neutron bomb. With a blast radius of six miles. And who can disarm this device? Only me. Thank you. Doctor. Bane snaps Dr. Pavels neck in front of the world. The bomb is armed, the bomb is mobile, the identity of the triggerman is a mystery. One of you holds the detonator we come not as conquerors, but as liberators to return control of this city to the people. At the first sign of interference from the outside world or of people attempting to flee, this anonymous Gothamite, this unsung hero, will trigger the bomb. For now, martial law is in effect. Return to your homes, hold your families close, and wait. Tomorrow you claim what is rightfully yours. Bane turns, leaves the field, followed by his men. The General breaks the silence. Pull back the fighters, start highlevel reconnaissance flights. And get the President on the line. Mercenaries hold the bridge. A tank rolls across from the mainland, soldiers behind. The Lead Mercenary uses a bullhorn Tanks and planes cannot stop us detonating our device. Send an emissary to discuss terms of access for supplies and communication. A Captain steps forward, walks to the apex of the bridge. How many of you are there, son? Nothing. You dont have enough men to stop twelve million people leaving that island. We dont. But you do. Why in the hell would we help you keep your hostages? If people start crossing this bridge Gotham gets blown to hell. The Captain considers this. Troubled. As night falls the Fs peel away from the fireringed city. The voice of the President echoes across the airwaves over radio The people of our greatest city are resilient. They have proven this before, they will prove this again Wayne stares at the old TV. At his burning city. over TV We do not negotiate with terrorists, but we do recognize realities Wayne starts to cry. Blake drives the deserted streets. Gordon is slumped in the passenger seat, listening. over radio As the situation develops, one thing must be understood above all others People of Gotham, we have not abandoned you. What does that mean? It means were on our own. I have to get in front of a camera Sir, theyll kill you the second you show your face The Mayors dead. Im the symbol of law and order. Bane says hes giving Gotham back to the people they need to know that I could lead Banes not gonna let that happen Then hell show his true colors. And you be dead. Gordon says nothing. Three camouflage Tumblers roll down the deserted street. A crowd of news crews has gathered. Guards in the towers look down, apprehensive. The Tumblers roll up, stopping in front of the gates. Bane emerges from the lead Tumbler. Behind you stands a symbol of oppression. Blackgate Prison... Prisoners strain to hear Banes words. Selina is there. Where a thousand men have languished for years. Under the Dent Act. Under the name of this man Bane holds up a photo of Harvey Dent. Harvey Dent. Held up to you, and over you, as a shining example of justice and good. Gordon sits watching Banes speech. Blake gathers supplies. Were gonna keep moving you, till we can get you in front of a camera Bane sets fire to the picture of Dent... But they supplied you a false idol. A straw man. To placate. To stop you tearing down this corrupt city The Prisoners start cheering, shouting. .and rebuilding it the way it should have been rebuilt generations ago... Bane drops the burning picture. Let me tell you the truth about Harvey Dent. In the words of Gothams Police Commissioner, James Gordon This gets Blakes attention. Gordon watches, uneasy.. Bane unfolds the pages of Gordon s undelivered speech The truth about Harvey Dent is simple in only one regard it has been hidden for too long. After his devastating injuries, Harveys mind has recovered no better than his mutilated face. He was a broken, dangerous man, not the crusader for justice that I, James Gordon, have portrayed him to be for the last eight years. Harveys rage was indiscriminate. Psychopathic. He held my family at gunpoint, then fell to his death in the struggle over my sons life. The Batman did not murder Harvey Dent He'saved BANE contd my boy. Then took the blame for Harveys appalling crimes, so that I could, to my shame, build a lie around this fallen idol. Blake stares at the TV, Gordon s face lowers into his hands I praised the madman who tried to murder my own child. The crowd is silent, stunned, as Bane continues to read. The things we did in Harvey s name brought desperately needed security to our streets... But I can no longer live with my lie. It is time to trust the people of Gotham with the truth, and it is time for me to resign Bane folds the papers. Looks out to the stunned crowd. Do you accept this man s resignation? Individuals in the crows start shouting Yes! Prisoners cheer, pounding against the bars. Selina watches Do you accept the resignation of all the liars?! All the corrupt?! More and more of the crowd is chanting Yes! Blake turns to Gordon, who stares at the TV. These men, locked up in Blackgate for eight years, denied parole under the Dent Act. Based on a lie. A lie to keep a city from burning to the ground. Gotham needed a hero, someone to believe in Not as much as it does now. But you betrayed everything you stood for. looks at Blake Theres a point. Far out there. When the structures fail you. When the rules arent weapons anymore, theyre shackles, letting the bad get ahead. Maybe one day youll have such a moment of crisis. And in that moment, I hope you have a friend like I did. To plunge their hands into the filth so you can keep yours clean. Your hands look pretty filthy to me. Commissioner. Gordon stares at him. Blake goes back to packing. Bane signals a Tumbler its turret turns to the prison doors We take Gotham from the corrupt. The rich. The oppressors of generations whove kept you down with the myth of opportunity. And we give it to you, the people. Gotham is yours none shall interfere. Do as you please... The Tumbler fires, blowing the doors to hell. Ill BANE contd But start by storming Blackgate and freeing the oppressed. Step forward, those who would serve... Banes men surge through the burning gates... Selina watches as Prisoners stream out of open cell doors. She makes her way quietly through the excited throng. For an army will be raised Mercenaries hand out weapons to escaping Prisoners... As Mercenaries shoot open locks, people storm into expensive apartment buildings overlooking the park... The powerful will be ripped from their decadent nests. People ransack the apartment... and cast into the cold world the rest of us have known and endured. Wealthy people are herded onto the street by Mercenaries... Courts will be convened A kangaroo court is in session, presided over by a Criminal we recognize from Blackgate. Bane watches from the gallery The spoils will be enjoyed. Toughlooking Revellers crack open champagne spraying it, swigging it Selina amongst them, watching... Blood will be shed. Hundreds of Police living underground. Dividing up supplies lowered by ropes... Ross opens a pack of supplies. But the police will live until they are ready to serve true justice. Moving in on the bright glow of the core... This great city will endure. Close enough to see the flickering digits of its countdown Gotham will survive. Mercenaries load the core into the back of a black truck. Wayne rolls of his cot. Grunts. The Prisoner realizes Wayne is trying to do a pushup. From the next cell, the Blind Prisoner says something... He'says you must first straighten your back. The Prisoner helps Wayne roll over, painfully. How would he know? He was the prison doctor. A morphine addict who incurred the displeasure of powerful people. Including your masked friend. How? Many years ago, during a time of plague. Bane was attacked by other prisoners. The doctors fumbling attempts to repair the damage left him in perpetual agony. The mask holds his pain at bay. Is Bane the child you spoke of? Was he born here? The legens is that there was a mercenary working for the local warlord who fell in love with his daughter. They married in secret. The Prisoner takes a rope ties it under Waynes arms. When the warlord found out, he condemned the mercenary to this pit. But then exiled him instead. INSERT CUT the Mercenary is dropped at the side of a barren road. He'starts to walk. The mercenary understood that the warlord s daughter had secured his release, but he couldnt know the true price of his freedom. She had taken his place in the pit. INSERT CUT a Woman is lowered into the prison. The prisoners below all have their faces covered with muslin masks And she was with the child. The mercenarys child. INSERT CUT the Woman watches as the Doctor, the Blind Prisoner, youngerlooking, sighted examines her small child. The Doctor exits, locking the cell... One day the doctor forgot the lock the cell INSERT CUT Prisoners move into the cell towards his mother. The child runs at them with a knife... Innocence cannot flower underground. It was to be stamped out. But the child had a friend. A protector INSERT CUT the Protector, face covered, pulls the Child off the attackers. One grabs for the Child the Protector snaps his arm, carries the Child into a corner... ...who showed the other that this innocence was their redemption. The mother was not so lucky. The Blind Prisoner shouts at the Prisoner. He nods. This is Banes prison now. Bane would not want this story told. The Prisoner pulls Wayne screams in pain as he is pulled upright. The Prisoner ties him off. Checks his spine. You have a protruding vertebra ... I m going to force it back How The Prisoner punches Wayne in the back, hard. Wayne screams. You stay like this. Until you stand Wayne passes out from the pain and we FADE TO BLACK. Wayne is hanging in his cell, delirious. Did you not think Id return, Bruce Ra s al Ghul, in his Ducard guise, steps in front of Wayne. I told you I was immortal. I watched you die. There are many forms of immortality Wayne looks inward, remembering... INSERT CUT Ra s at the campfire from Batman Begins Once I had a wife. My great love. She was taken from me INSERT CUT the Woman is lowered into the prison... Wayne looks at Ras. You were the mercenary. Bane is your child. Your heir. INSERT CUT the Mercenary at the side of the road. Ras. An heir to ensure the League of Shadows fulfills its duty to restore balance to civilization. No You yourself fought the decadence of Gotham for years. With all your strength and resources, all your moral authority. And the only victory you could achieve was a lie. Finally you understand ... Gotham is beyond saving And must be allowed to die. CUT TO WHITE. And we are Snow blankets the street. A Tumbler carves tracks as it patrols the deserted street. Blake peers from behind a parked car he is crouched, feeding a kite string down a storm drain. Ross strains to reach a note dangling on a string he grasps it. All around him are dozens of Cops living underground. Blake winds the string, picks up a jerrycan, hurries off. The home is packed. People, not just kids, huddle in every corner. Blake spots Father Reilly. Hands him the can. For the bus in case theres a chance to evacuate. Keep it in here people are siphoning parked cars. Really? grins How do you think I got it? Right. Any news? Is the Commissioner Less you know. Father. How re the boys Powers been on more, so they get some TV. Blake smiles. Moves to the door. Blake, you be careful out there. Theyre hunting down cops like dogs Blake nods. Leaves. Following Selina through rooms strewn with trash, empty bottles and sleeping partygoers SHe'spots a family photograph, glass smashed. A hand lands on her shoulder. Who s that? This was someones home. Now its everyones home. Selina stares out at a Tumbler rolling by. Storms coming, remember? This is what you wanted. No. Its what I thought I wanted. The Prisoner unties the rope from Waynes chest. Wayne stands. Just. Then walks. Wayne does pushups. Stronger. The Prisoner watches. Why build yourself? Im not meant to die in here. The Prisoner indicates the TV Here? There? Whats the difference? Wayne ignores this. Focuses on his body... Wayne moves to the wall takes the rope from the Tattooed Prisoner, wraps it around his chest. Curious Prisoners gather, the Prisoner at their head. Wayne looks up at the light, hundreds of feet above. Starts to climb. Prisoners get excited as Wayne RISES money starts exchanging hands. Reaching the precipice, he checks his rope, looks up at the next handhold, far away. He takes a breath, then LEAPS. His fingers brush the ledge. Wayne DROPS a hundred feet the rope catches, SLAMMING him into the rock face. The Prisoners disperse, losing interest as the Tattooed Prisoner lowers Wayne on the rope. The Blind Prisoner turns away. I told you it could not be done. You told me a child did it... No ordinary child. INSERT CUT the Protector fights off prisoners as the Child, older now, moves to the climbing wall A child born in hell. INSERT CUT the Child makes the climb .. .pauses, looking down making eyecontact with the Protector, who fights off Prisoners... They swarm over the Protector, knives drawn. A child forged by suffering, hardened by pain. INSERT CUT the Child leaps across the abyss, grabbing a handhold on the ledge and swinging up. Not a man from privilege. Waynes eyes close in despair. Supply trucks await inspection. Mercenaries open an wheeler check boxes of rat ions ... wave it on... The wheeler pulls up. A line of Gothamites waits patiently along the sidewalk. Three plainclothes Special Forces Men emerge from the boxes, checking, then concealing weapons. The doors open they exit. The special Forces Men carry boxes into the store as if delivering. The store Manager leads them into the back and down into Where they are met by four Cops out of uniform. You have ID? Of course not How can we trust you? They dont have any choice. Gordon and Blake emerge from the back of the room. Commissioner Gordon? Captain Jones, Special Forces. Captain, glad to have you here. How many of you are there? Dozens. Id rather not say exactly. But the men trapped underground number almost three thousand. What kind of shape they re in? Theyve been getting water, food. Could we break them out? Yes, sir take out the mercenaries guarding the outflow south of Ackerman Park, blow the rubble, youve got a hole big enough for ten at a time. Im in contact with my partner theyre waiting for the day. Men who havent seen daylight for three months? Men with automatic weapons who havent seen daylight in three months What about the bomb? The satellites cant see any radiation hot spots Blake scouts with Jones. A rumble makes them turn. They keep it on a truck it must have a leadlined roof. They move it constantly But you know the truck? Theyve got three of them. The routes dont vary much. Two Tumblers lead a massive black truck down the street. Captain Jones reaches into his jacket and triggers a Geiger counter. Shows Blake the display. Nods. One of the Tumblers stops, turns back. Blake leads them down a side street. What about the triggerman? No leads. Its a bluff Bane wouldnt give control of that bomb to someone else. We cant take that chance. Until we have the triggerman, we just track the device, smuggle men over While Gotham lives under a warlord, like in some failed state? Dial it back, officer. This situation is unprecedented. We cant do anything to risk millions of lives. to Gordon Arent you gonna tell him?! Captain, things are more complicated than you think. Theres somebody you need to meet. Blake? Blake nods, leads Jones and his men up the stairs. Blake leads them to the door of an empty bank. They head across the empty lobby to an elevator. Blake leads them into empty offices. Cots and makeshift furnishings line the offices and corridors. I was up here looking for a vantage point. Found the people who run the corporation who owns it living here Which corporation? Wayne Enterprises. Lucius Fox is there, with Miranda Tate. Captain, meet Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox, Id like you to brief the Captain. Captain Jones indicates Miranda. Miss Tate is fully aware of the situation And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I have to take responsibility for it. Why? Because, Captain, we built it. You built the bomb? It was built as a fusion reactor. The first of its kind. Bane turned the core into a bomb, then disconnected it from the reactor. And heres the important part. As the devices fuel cells decay, its becoming increasingly unstable ... until the point of detonation The bombs a time bomb. And it will go off. In twentythree days Captain Jones reels at this news. Banes revolution is a sham. Hes watching Gotham rearrange its deckchairs while the whole ships going down. Your appeasement plan might not be as practical as you thought Captain Jones throws Blake a look. Addresses Fox. Could you disarm it? I dont know. But I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it. Wed have to let the Pentagon know. They be monitoring our frequencies We have no choice. Lets move away from this location, then call it m Captain Jones exits the elevator, followed by his men and Blake. Halfway across the floor, hell breaks loose. Mercenaries blast them with machine guns the lobby becomes a devastating ambush. Blake dives back into the elevator. Blake flies out of the elevator. Fox, somebody sold us out! Fox and Miranda burst into the corridor. Take Miranda Blake grabs Miranda, heads for the back stairs. Mercenaries jump out of the elevator, firing high. Fox freezes. Lowers himself to the ground. Captain Jones goes down in a hail of bullets. The other Special Forces Men are down. Bane enters, midges Jones with his toe. He is alive. Barely. Bane leans in close. Jones looks up at him, defiant. Ill die before I talk... Im on your schedule. Captain. Bane places his hand over Joness nose and mouth. There were people living upstairs. Bane looks up, disinterested. Jones is dead. Give them over for judgement. Indicates bodies. Hang them where the world will see. Wayne stares at the TV the special Forces bodies hang in the cables of Gotham Bridge. Wayne throws a stone into the screen Wayne does endless pushups, squats, stretches. The Blind Prisoner listens. He'speaks in an ancient tongue. He'says the leap to freedom is not about strength. My body makes the jump. cracked English Survival is the spirit. The soul. My souls as ready to escape as my body Fear is why you fail. Im not afraid. Im angry. Wayne throws punches ... focused Wayne takes the rope at the foot of the climb. Prisoners look up, but none bother to gather round. Wayne starts climbing, determined. He FIGHTS the rock f ace ... breathing hard. Grabs at a rock it comes away in his hand. He DROPS SMASHES into the rock face. The Blind Prisoner shakes his head. A Skinny Prisoner playing cards with the Prisoner looks up at Wayne, hanging upside down. Shouldnt you get him down? The Prisoner glances up at Wayne, disdainful. Hell keep As Wayne drifts into unconsciousness we INSERT CUT Young Bruce lies at the bottom of the well, looking up at his father, lowering down to rescue him. And why do we fall? Wayne wakes with a start the Blind Prisoner is there. cracked English You do not fear death. You think this makes you strong. This makes you weak. Why? How can you move faster then possible? Fight longer than possible? If not from the most powerful impulse of the spirit. The fear of death. The will to survive. Wayne gets up onto his elbow. Looks at the Blind Prisoner. I do fear death. I fear dying in here while my city burns with no one there to save it. Then make the climb. How? As the child did. Without the rope. Dry laugh. Then fear will find you again. Wayne considers this. Wayne puts some scraps of bread into a rough coat which he folds into a makeshift shoulder pack. Supplies for your journey? Prisoners nearby laugh. Wayne moves to the cliff face. The Prisoner follows, intrigued by Waynes new demeanor. The Tattooed Prisoner offers him the rope. Wayne refuses. Starts to climb. Prisoners gather around as word spreads. Wayne makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face. Down below the Prisoners start a low chant. As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something EXPLODES from the cliff face. Wayne flinches BATS... They circle up to the opening above... Wayne closes his eyes. The chant RISES. Wayne takes a breath ... opens his eyes... looks down at the drop... up again... then he jumps. Time skips a beat as the Prisoners stop breathing. And Wayne GRABS the ledge above. The Prisoners go WILD as Wayne hoists himself up onto the ledge. The Blind Prisoner nods. Wayne climbs to FREEDOM. Wayne climbs out of the hole and into formidable desolation. He'shoulders his pack spots a large coil of rope attached to the wall. He pushes it into the hole then walks away... A mass of huddled Gothamites. Professionals traders, industrialists In a corner. Fox. Mercenaries come down into the chamber, pull out a man, who starts yelling. It is Stryver, Daggetts functionary. I want to see Bane! Theres been a mistake! Take me to Bane! Fox watches him dragged upstairs... A kangaroo court. Stryver is dragged before a jeering crowd. Theres been a mistake! Wheres Bane Theres been no mistake, Mr. Stryver Stryver turns to look at the judge Dr. Jonathan Crane. You are Philip Stryver, executive vicepresident of Daggett Industries? Off nod from Stryver The same Philip Stryver who for years lived like a prince off the blood and sweat of people less powerful Call Bane! Im one of you! Jeers. Pull back to reveal a silent figure, watching. Bane. Bane has no authority here. This is merely a sentencing hearing. The choice is yours, death or exile. Stryver looks around, terrified, as the crowd shouts Death Exile smashes gavel Sold... to the man in the cold sweat Mercenaries pull Stryver from the dock... Stryver, with other wealthy Gothamites, is led down to the ice. A Blackgate Inmate undoes his handcuffs, whispering. Follow the tick ice. Try to swim youre dead in minutes. Has anyone made it? The Blackgate Inmate turns away. Stryver is forced onto the ice. He'shuffles forward, listening to the creaking... Stryver is a hundred yards out when the river swallows him. Gordon stands over a map of the city. A handful of Cops sit around the room. Waiting. Gordon looks at his watch. Where the hell are they? Its not like we have a lot of time, here. How long? The bomb goes off tomorrow. Weve got about eighteen hours to do something To do what? We mark that truck. Get a GPS on it, then we can start thinking about how to take it down. The door opens and Blake enters, followed by ten cops. Gordon is counting them in. He moves to Blake. low That s it? Blake just looks at him. Gordon checks the faces. Realizes. Foley. Wheres Foley, dammit?! Gordon heads for the door. You shouldnt be out on the streets Gordon hurries up the steps to a brownstone. Stabs the bell. Jim. Hes not here Gordon, furious, addresses the hallway behind her. Youre sending your wife to the door when the city s under occupation? Foley appears at the end of the corridor. Ashamed. Wait in the kitchen, honey. What did you do, bury your uniform in the backyard? Jim, you saw what they did to those Special Forces. You forgotten all the years we went out on patrol with every gangbanger wanting to plant one as soon as our backs were turned? This is different and you know it. These guys run the city the governments done a deal with them Deal?! Banes got their balls in a vice. Thats not a deal You move against Bane, the triggerman s gonna hit the button You think hes given control of that bomb to one of the people?! You think this is part of some revolution? Theres one man with his finger on the button Bane. We have to keep our heads down until they can fix this. If you still had family here maybe youd This only gets fixed from inside the city, Foley. Calmer. Look, Im not asking you to walk down Grand in your dress blues. But weve got to do something before this maniac blows us all to hell. Im sorry Jim. I gotta Keep your head down? Whats that gonna do tomorrow, when that thing blows You dont know thats going to happen Foley closes the door on Gordon. Gordon stands there. I hear youre looking for men. Commissioner Gordon turns to see Miranda, Blake behind her. Blake shrugs. How about me, instead? Miss take, I cant ask you My company built it. Bruce Wayne built it. And he wanted to destroy it. It was me who didnt listen. Please. Gordon looks at Blake. Then Miranda. Nods. Let s go A Kid sprints down the deserted street, chased by two Gangbangers The Kid slips in the snow the men are on him. You steal from us, you little bastard? They grab the Kids backpack, the Gangbanger pulls out an apple, moves to hit the Kid when SMACK! his hand is grabbed, and the apple flies into the air as his arm cracks. Selina catches the apple. You boys know you cant come into my neighborhood without asking politely Gangbanger lunges with a knife sHe'spins him, making him stab himself in the backside. The Gangbangers run off, howling. The Kid eyes her, wary. Never steal anything from someone you cant outrun, kid. Now youre gonna take it. Selina looks at the red apple. Takes one perfect bite. Just tax. She tosses him the apple. He takes it and runs. Pretty generous, for a thief. Selina recognizes the voice. Turns to find Wayne strong, but weathered. Beard, work clothes. You came back. I thought theyd killed you. Not yet If youre expecting an apology It wouldnt suit you. I need your help And why would I help you? Wayne pulls a USB drive out of his pocket. For this. The Clean Slate. Youre gonna trust me with that? After what I did to you? I admit I felt a little let down. But I still think theres more to you. In fact, I think for you indicates USB this isnt a tool, its an escape route. You want to disappear. Start fresh. She looks at him. Takes the drive, staring at it. Start fresh? I cant even get off this island. I can give you a way off. Once youve gotten me to Lucius Fox. I need you to find out where theyre holding him. Then take me in. Why do you need Fox? To save this city. Who says it needs like it this way. Maybe you do But bombs going off. Get your powerful case Im trying. But I saving? Maybe I tomorrow that friend on the need Fox. Gordon and his Men are in twoman teams. Gordon is walking down the street with Miranda. He hands her a Geiger counter. Stay further up the block. Points at Men. Theyre gonna cross the street and try and slow the truck down. As it approaches, hit this button. If the needle hits two hundred give me the signal and I mark the truck. Okay? over radio Heads up. Blake is up on a rooftop. Gordon moves down to the other end of the block. As the truck rumbles into view, Gordons Men walk out into the street in front of it as if crossing the road. The convoy barely slows. Miranda gives Gordon the signal. As the truck comes past, he tosses a magnetic GPS locator at the lower part of the truck... Gordon regroups with his Men on the corner. Checks his GPS. Got it They keep moving, turning down the next street ... into an ambush. Dozens of Mercenaries, weapons trained. Commissioner Gordon, youre under arrest On whose authority? The people of Gotham. Blake, from his vantage point, watches Gordon, Miranda and the other Cops being rounded up and led away... Miranda comforts a crying Woman in the corner. Thugs come down the stairs, laughing, leading a Hooded Prisoner. They kick him down the last step and He'stumbles. Fox moves to his aid. Find this one a spot, hes got a big day tomorrow. They dump the Hooded Man with Fox. We all do. Irs not every day you bag Bruce Wayne Fox hears this. Pulls the bag from Waynes head. Wayne nods at him, silent. Fox nods back. The Thugs leave. Miranda comes over. Bruce You picked a hell of a time to go on vacation, Mr. Wayne. How long until the core ignites? That bomb goes off in twelve hours. Unless we can connect it to the reactor If you can get it there. Ill find a way to plug it back in. Indicates Miranda. Can you get Miranda out? Not tonight. Im sorry. Do whats necessary. to Fox Tonight I need you. What for? To get me back in the game. Catwoman comes down the stairs with the Thugs. Sorry to spoil things, boys, but Bane wants these guys himself... The thugs pull Wayne and Fox to their feet Miranda looks up I wont forget about you. I know. The Thugs lead Wayne and Fox along the colonnade. Catwoman spins, takes out one Thug with a heel, one with a punch to the throat. Fox smiles as she unlocks his wrists. I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne. He'should be so lucky. And shes gone. Fox turns to Wayne. Who shrugs. Lights flicker on... Wayne and Fox are in the BatBunker. Any move I make against Bane or the bomb the triggerman sets it off. They cant be using radio or cell too much interference. Infrared doesnt have the range. It could only be microburst long wave... Wayne opens a panel in the wall, takes out equipment minimines, Batarangs, utility belt... Could you block it? Yes. I need the EMP cannonguidance mount from the Bat. You remember where you parked? Wayne nods. Smiles. The Batsuit rises from the floor Gordon and his men on trial. Crane presides. The charges are espionage and attempted sabotage... Do you have anything to say in your defense? No lawyer, no witnesses. What sort of due process is this? More than you give Harvey s prisoners. Commissioner. Your guilt is determined, this is merely a sentencing hearing. Whats it to be, death or exile? Crane, if you think we are going willingly out onto that ice, youve got another think coming. Death, than? Looks that way. Very well... Death... Smiles. By exile He'smashes his gavel. Bane leans in to one of his men, indicates Miranda. Bring her to me. Wayne bounds up the stairs. Fox follows, out of breath I think its time to talk about my yearend bonus Fox emerges to see Wayne uncovering the Bat... As the sun sets. Fox starts pulling apart the gun mount. She fly pretty well? Even without the autopilot... Autopilot? Thats what youre there for Gordon and the rest of the men stand at the edge of the ice A Mercenary fires his gun in the air. Gordon takes a breath then leads his men onto the ice... which creaks and groans.. Further out, Gordon stops sniffs looks down a pool of liquid, beside it a flare. Gordon picks it up, puzzled. Light it up. Gordon, energized by the familiar voice, lights the flare jams it into the liquid, sending a trail of FIRE across the ice up into a building where it forms the shape of a Dad! Check it out! Honey, take a look! Foley moves to a back window. Sees the flaming sign. A Mercenary nervously approaches Banes back. Sir? Bane turns. The Mercenary points at the sign. You think its really him? Impossible Foley yanks up the floorboards. Pull his dress blues from their hiding place. Mercenaries guarding the entrance see the sign. One of them moves out to get a better look. WHAM! He is taken out by a dark figure. The figure steps into the light it is Blake Batman hands Gordon a metal box. This blocks the remote detonator signal to the bomb. Get into onto the truck by sunrise. They might hit the button when it starts. When what starts? War Blake takes out a second Mercenary moves over to the open manhole. Ross emerges nots at Blake, who helps him climb out. BANG Ross goes down as Blake dives for cover. Blake is grabbed by Mercenaries. They detonate the manhole, sealing it, prepare to execute Blake. A dark shape drops onto the Mercenaries... Blake watches, in awe, as Batman takes them out in a fury of punches and kicks then it is finished. Quiet. One of the Mercenaries moves slightly. You missed a spot. Batman boots him in the head as he moves towards Blake. If youre working alone, wear a mask No one cares who I am. The mask is not for you. Its to protect the people you care about Huh. And you always seem to know where those people are. How is that? I lost someone once. Since then I break into their homes when theyre sleeping and implant a tracking device on the back of their neck. Blake laughs. Then feels the back of his neck. Batman tosses Blake a minimine. On three one, two, three They throw the minimines at the rubble of the entrance the blasts barely move any rubble. No offense, but you got anything bigger in that belt? Thats to warn the men on the other side Batman disappears into the shadows. But how do we KAABOOOM! The Bats cannons light up the night. Okay Cops climb out into the cold night skinny, ragged, but glad to be alive and carrying guns... What now? Allout assault on Bane... but you need to get the people your care about across the bridge. Why? In case we fail. Lead an exodus across the bridge. Save as many lives as you can. Dont you need me here? Youve given me an army. Now go. Blake nods. Turns to leave. Stops. Thank you. Dont thank me yet. I might not get a chance later. Batman nods. Blake disappears into the night. Gordon checks the metal box. Puts it under his coat. Nods at his men, hiding in the doorways. Checks his GPS... Batman leads Catwoman to a rusty old container. He opens it, revealing the BatPod. Catwoman s eyes light up. Oh, you shouldnt have... She hops on, feeling the controls. The midtown tunnels blocked by debris, but the cannons give you enough firepower to make a path for people Catwoman marvels at the controls... To start it, you I got it Weve got fortyfive minutes to save this city No, Ive got fortyfive minutes to get clear of the blast radius, because you dont stand a chance against these guys. With your help I might. SHe'shakes her head. Ill open that tunnel, then Im gone He looks at her. Theres more to you than that. SHe'stares back at him. Facade slipping a touch. Sorry to keep letting you down. He'says nothing. She looks at him, imploring. Come with me. Save yourself. You dont owe these people anymore youve given them everything Not everything. Not yet. Batman turns. Catwoman watches him go. Then fires up the bike and takes off. Catwoman tears along on the BatPod. She pulls up at the tunnel entrance blocked by stacked vehicles. The army of Cops stands at the low end of the street. At the op is Banes stronghold City Hall. Men pour out of the building, forming up into an opposing line. A Cop wearing full dress blues steps forward. It is Foley. The silence is eerie... The numbers look evenly matched until two Tumblers arrive. over loudspeaker The Cops look shaky, pale, but determined. Theres only one police in this city He'steps forward. The line follows. Bane stands in the colonnade. Watching. Open fire. The Tumblers FIRE into the line of Cops, THROWING men into the air, SCREAMING. The line of Cops is about to scatter WHOOOSHHH. The Bat DROPS down in front of the Cops and BLASTS both Tumblers, FLIPPING them sideways. The Bat RISES and the cops run towards the Mercenaries, firing until they are close enough to fight handtohand. The street is filled with thousands of men in pitched battle. Catwoman, hearing the distant battle, blasts the tunnel blockage ... the dust settles. Her path is clear. Gordon heard the fighting. Checks the box. Nervous. Come on, come on... Bane strides through the battle, taking out Cops left and right. A space clears he is face the face with the Batman You came back. To die with your city No. I came back to stop you. Bane leaps at batman, smashing powerful blows into his head. Batman ducks, weaves and smashes his fists into Banes side. Someone is watching from the window of City Hall Miranda. The black truck rounds the corner. Gordon signals his man in a Greyhound bus who pulls across the street. The truck smashes into the bus and stops. Gordon and his men swarm in, blasting at the Guards. Gordon opens the back empty. No bomb. Wrong truck. Thats impossible... Come on! Cut over to Fifth! They sprint for the next parallel avenue... Fox hurries into the reactor starts throwing switches... Blake leads the boys out of the home points down the street Knock on doors, spread the word the bombs going to blow! Get out by the south Street tunnel, or over the bridge! Do two blocks, then get back to the bus The boys race down the street. Father Reilly climbs into the bus Batman and Bane fight. Batman pushing Bane back a Tumbler roars between them, separating them. Batman chases after. Bane SMASHES backwards through the door. Batman on him. Batman POUNDS Bane against the marble floor. Mercenaries guarding Miranda move towards them Stay back. He is mine Bane SMASHES Batmans head moves in for the kill, but Batman SMASHES Ben to the ground, RIPS sideways across the tubes of Banes mask with the blades of his forearm. Bane bellows, thrashing in AGONY. Batman holds him down with a hand on his throat searches him with his free hand. Give me the trigger! Youd never give it to an ordinary citizen Banes thrashing calms as He'stares at batman through painsoaked eyes ... gasping through his broken mask for relief I broke you. How have you come back? You thought you were the only one who could learn the strength to escape? Bane looks at Batman, curiosity behind his pain. I never escaped Ra s al Ghul rescued me. That is why I mist fulfill his plan. That is why I must avenge his murder. confused The child of Ra s al Ghul made the climb But he is not the child of Ra s al Ghul Batman flinches, frozen as Miranda leans into his ear... I am. Miranda has a knife through Batmans suit, into his ribs... And though I am not ordinary, I am a citizen She pulls out the trigger... Gordon spots the second black truck moving down the street. His men pull in front, slowing it. Gordon jumps into the back. The truck accelerates Gordon drops, hanging on to the bumper, struggling with the box, trying to turn it on... Batman cannot move to defend himself. He has Bane by the throat, but Miranda has her knife in his side My mother named me Talia before she was killed. The way I wouldve been killed if not for my protector. .Bane. INSERT CUT the child, Talia, makes eyecontact with the Protector, then leaps. Down below. Prisoners swarm over the protector, ripping the muslin from his face. Bane looks up at Talia, says one quiet word Goodbye Then is overrun. I climbed out of the pit... INSERT CUT Young Talia stands by the hole looking out at the landscape... I found my father and brought him back to exact terrible vengeance but by that time... the prisoners and the doctor had done their work to my friend. .my protector... Talia reaches up to touch Banes mask. INSERT CUT the League of Shadows descend into the prison at their head, Ras al Ghul. They slaughter prisoners. Then stop. Ras al Ghul has found Bane, bandaged. The League took us in. Trained us Bane in a prototype mask, stands on logs, blocking blows from men with sticks. But my father could not accept Bane Ras al Ghul watches Bane training. Turns away. Talia looks into Banes eyes as she holds the knife in Batman s side He'saw only a monster who could never be tamed. Whose very existence was a reminder of the hell hed left his wife to die in. He excommunicated Bane from the League of Shadows. His only crime was that he loved me. I could not truly forgive my father. Talia looks at Batman, cold. Until you murdered him. He was trying to kill millions of innocent people Innocent is a strong word to throw around Gotham, Bruce. I honor my father by finishing his work. Vengeance against the man who killed him is simply a reward for my patience Talia twists the knife in Batmans side. You see, its the slow knife... the knife that takes its time, the TALIA contd knife that waits years without forgetting, then slips quietly between bones ... that s the knife Talia arms the trigger... that cuts deepest. She hits the button nothing. A light on the metal box is blinking. Gordon hangs on Talia turns, furious. Your knife may have been too slow A Mercenary steps forward The truck s under attack Talia looks around, mind racing. Gordon. To Batman. You gave him a way to block my signal. No matter Looks at watch. Hes bought Gotham eleven minutes. Shouts at Mercenary. Prepare a convoy. We must secure the bomb until it detonates Talia jumps to her feet. Bane grabs a shotgun from a Mercenary points it at Batman. Not yet... I want him to heel the heat. To Batman. Feel the fire of twelve million souls you failed. Talia reaches up to Banes mask, reconnects his tubes, tenderly Goodbye, my friend. Bane nods at her, slowly. Talia moves out with the Mercenaries Talia gets into a Tumbler with a Mercenary. Three Tumblers pull out in convoy, blowing anything out of the way cars, cops Foley stands in the road, firing his sidearm. Talia s Tumbler SMASHES him out of the way. Bane grabs Batman, throws him into the floor checks the rounds in the barrels. You have to imagine the fire He'shuts the gun jams it into Batmans face. We both know I need to kill you now. He'squeezes the trigger. BLAMMM! Bane is blasted across the lobby by cannon fire. Catwoman is there, on the BatPod. The whole noguns thing? I dont feel as strongly about it as you do Blake pulls up to the barricade, leads the kids off, marching them up the bridge. Father Reilly at the rear. A Uniform shouts through the loudhailer Stay there! What are you doing?! pulls badge Blake, MCU Im getting these boys to safety Safety?! Youre gonna get us all killed. Anyone crosses this bridge they blow the city Its gonna blow anyway. We need this bridge open right now. No one leaves the island. Orders Whose orders? Banes? Police Departments. Havent you heard the shooting? The Batman s battling it out with Bane The Batmans dead. Look, Officer Its Detective Well, Detective, you take one more step, we have to shoot you. Two more steps, we have to blow the bridge to the boys Wait for me back at the bus. The Boys walk back down the bridge... Talia s convoy surrounds the black truck. Tumblers off each flank, protecting the bomb as it counts down... Batman looks at Catwoman I need you on the ground, me in the air, we have to force that convoy east, to the entrance to the reactor Catwoman roars down the steps on the BatPod. Gordon climbs into the back of the truck the bomb is there, heating up. He looks at the countdown nine minutes Blake turns back to the Uniform. Your orders are out of date! The situations changed! Listen, Im a cop like you. And Im walking out there. Please dont shoot me. Blake walks. Shots ring out at his feet. He keeps walking.. The Bat descends on the convoy, Catwoman approaches on the ground. A rolling battle ensues. Catwoman targets the rear of the Tumblers, Batman swings the Bat in low at the junctions, trying to force the convoy east... The Tumblers gun turrets swing around onto Catwoman. SHe'swerves to avoid heave fire. Blake continues to walk, ignoring the warning shots. Sonofabitch To his partner. Blow it! Before he reaches the line His partner arms the detonator. Uniform shouts at Blake Get down! Were blowing the bridge! As Blake looks, disbelieving, the bridge in front of him blasts upwards in a massive fireball. Blake dives backwards The Bat blasts away in front of the convoy, making a huge crater in front of a Tumbler and trapping it, rear in the air. Catwoman dodges around it, uses the BatPod cannons to take out another Tumbler... The countdown ticks away... seven minutes As Fox fires up the reactor something catches his eye something is wrong. The smoke clears, Blake sees the impossible gap. You idiots! You sons of bitches! Youre killing us!! Gordon climbs out the back of the truck but is immediately strafed by gunfire from the Tumblers. He dives back inside, moves to the front of the trailer looks at the bulkhead, gauging the drivers position. Starts firing blind through the bulkhead Bullets fly through the cab. The driver takes one, falls forward, dead. Talia takes the wheel bullets keep coming. Blake races back. Father Reilly has the boys in a huddle, praying Father! Get the boys on the bus But theres nowhere to go, son. The Bat spins down in front of the black truck, forcing it into a hard right turn. Talia watches the navigation screen. over radio Theyre trying to force us onto Grand Pushing us to the entrance of the reactor. Theyre going to try and reconnect the core. over radio Can they? Talia smiles. Fox runs to a ladder. Alarms sound. As he hits the ladder he turns. A massive rumble builds water SMASHES into the reactor, flooding in from both directions. Catwoman comes up behind the lead Tumbler. She blasts it again and again it flips diagonally into the path of the black truck, causing the truck to lurch onto its side. Both vehicles careen into the mouth of the tunnel Fox loops his arm around a rung of the ladder and braces as a wave smashes into him, painfully... Gordon jumps out of the truck, opening the rear doors to expose the glowing core. Catwoman pulls up on the BatPod. Give me a hand! The Bat lands at the tunnel mouth. Gordon moves in to try and grab the core but it is too hot. Lets get a cable on it and drag it out! Come on, were almost there Laughter. Gordon turns. Talia, lying half out the truck. Dying Fox showed me how to operate the reactor core. Including the emergency flood Fox pulls himself above the rising whitewater Gordon looks down at Talia. Batman is at his side. There is no way to stop this bomb. Prepare yourselves... Looks up at Batman. My fathers work is done. Talia smiles as her eyes flutter closed. Gordon turns Batman is at the core, plunging his hands into the heat to attach a hoist from the Bat. What re you doing? Two minutes. I can fly it out over the bay Catwoman is at his side as he works. Rig it out to fly over the water, then bail No autopilot. She takes this in. He'stands to face her. You couldve gone anywhere. Been anything. But you came back here. So did you. I guess were both suckers. She puts his arms around his neck. Kisses him. Batman moves to the Bat, Gordon alongside. So this is the part where you vanish, only this time you dont come back? Batman opens the canopy. Blake grabs at the smallest boys, shoving them onto the bus. Come on On the bus What re you doing? Protection from the blast Its an atom bomb Blake turns on Father Reilly, furious. You think they need to hear that in their last seconds? You think Im going to let them die without hope? Gordon puts a hand on Batmans arm. I never cared who you were And you were right. But shouldnt the people know the hero who saved them? A hero can be anyone. That was always the point. Batman sits into the cockpit, then looks again at Gordon. Anyone. A man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a little boys shoulders to let him know that the world hadnt ended... The canopy loses and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers INSERT CUT Gordon, in his uniform, wraps the overcoat around the Young Bruces shoulders, his eyes reassuring, loving Gordon looks up to the cockpit Bruce Wayne? but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the tunnel mouth. The Bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core... A building is in the way Batman fights the controls but theres no power to get over it. Blake shouts into the bus Heads down! Heads down, now! Blake, they need to make their peace Blake turns to him, furious. Theyre children! They have no peace to make An EXPLOSION from downtown Gotham. Blake looks across, startled, turns to the children on the bus. Get down! This is it! The smallest of the boys stares through the window past Blake No. Thats Batman! Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of Gotham, trailing smoke, the core hanging from it. It curves dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth of the river... the bay... the ocean... Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear BLAST wind and light and dust blowing VIOLENTLY but harmlessly over the bridge, the tunnel mouth, all of Gotham. As the nuclear dawn fades over Gotham, and we see its inhabitants start to raise their heads, and helicopters and boats converge on the island, we hear a voice. Jim Gordon. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss Blake pulls out his badge. Throws it into the river. I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy. Gordon is reading from A Tale of Two Cities. Opposite is Fox, arm in a sling, and Blake, grim. Another figure is there, whose face we do not yet see... I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Waynes grave. It is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.
