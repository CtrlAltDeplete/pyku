Go ask the maid if she heard what I said. Tell her to change the sheets on the bed. Mathildes come back to me. Fellas, dont leave me tonight. Tonight Im going back to fight. Wretched Mathildes in sight. My heart, my heart, stop beating so. Just make as if you didnt know. That Mathildes come back to me. My heart, I dont want you to say. Shes lovelier than when she went away. Mathilde, whos come back to me. My heart, stop beating overjoyed. Remember you were once destroyed. By Mathilde, whos come back to me. Fellas, please dont go away. Tell me that I mustnt stay. Mathildes coming back today. My hands, youll start to shake again. When you remember all the pain. Mathildes come back to me. Youll want to beat her black and blue. But dont do it, I beg of you. Mathildes come back to me. My hands, remember all the years. Remember when you caught my tears. Mathildes come back to me. My hands, youll want to touch her now. But please try and be strong somehow. Mathildes here, shes coming now, now. Mama, can you hear me yell. Your baby boys gone back to hell. Mathildes come back to me. Charley, champagne right away. I know youve been saving it for the holiday. But Mathildes come back to me. Go ask the maid if she heard what I said. Tell her to put the best sheets on the bed. Mathildes come back to me. My friends, dont count on me no more. Ive gone and crashed through heavens door. My sweet Mathildes here. Once more, once more. The little clocks stopped ticking now. Were swallowed in the stomached rue. The only sound to tear the night. Comes from the man upstairs. His bloated belching figure stomps. He may crash through the ceiling soon. The window sees trees cry from cold. And claw the moon. But we know dont we. And well dream wont we. Of Montague Terrace in blue. The girl across the hall makes love. Her thoughts lay cold like shattered stone. Her thighs are full of tales to tell. Of all the nights shes known. Your eyes ignite like cold blue fire. The scent of secrets everywhere. A fist filled with illusions. Clutches all our cares. But we know dont we. And well dream wont we. Of Montague Terrace in blue oh in blue. Each night I meant to say. Id missed her through the day. But Id forget it. I never said it. I passed the flower shop. Lord knows I meant to stop. But Id say tomorrow. Perhaps tomorrow. Tomorrow thered be time. Thered always be another spring. Time to make her laughter ring. Time to give her everything. Oh my Angelica, my Angelica. Theres so much you never knew. So much I always meant to say. And do, for you, for you. Angelica. And then the cold winds came. And when I spoke her name. And felt her near me. She couldnt hear me. Her shadow had been cast. Too many springs had passed. For Angelica. Sweet Angelica. Now in my solitude. I tend the flowers that I buy. As they slowly fade and die. Watered by the tears I cry. For my Angelica, my Angelica. Theres so much you never knew. So much I always meant to say. And do, for you, for you. Angelica. Angelica. Angelica. Angelica. Lady came from Baltimore. All she wore was lace. Didnt know that I was poor. She never saw my place. I was there to steal the money. Take her rings and run. Then I fell in love with the lady. Got away with none. Ladys name was Susan Moore. Daddy was the law. Didnt know that I was poor. And lived outside the law. Daddy said I was a thief. Didnt have the love. But I was Susans true belief. Married her for love. I was there to steal the money. Take her rings and run. Then I fell in love with the lady. Got away with none. Now she lived and built a wall. To keep the robbers out. Didnt care a thing at all. Thats what Im about. I was there to steal the money. Take her rings and run. Then I fell in love with the lady. Got away with none. Then I fell in love with the lady. Got away with none. Today is just another day. Tomorrow is a guess. But yesterday. Oh what Id give for yesterday. To relive one yesterday. And its happiness. When Joanna loved me. Every town was Paris. Every day was Sunday. Every month was May. When Joanna loved me. Every sound was music. Music made of laughter. Laughter that was bright and gay. But when Joanna left me. May became December. But even in December. I remember. Her touch. Her smile. And for a little while. She loves me. And once again its Paris. Paris on a Sunday. And the month is May. My death is like. a swinging door. a patient girl who knows the score. whistle for her. and the passing time. My death waits like. a bible truth. at the funeral of my youth. weep loud for that. and the passing time. My death waits like. a witch at night. and surely as our love is bright. lets laugh for us. and the passing time. But whatever is behind the door. there is nothing much to do. angel or devil I dont care. for in front of that door. there is you. My death waits like. a beggar blind. who sees the world with an unlit mind. throw him a dime. for the passing time. My death waits. to allow my friends. a few good times before it ends. lets drink to that. and the passing time. My death waits in. your arms, your thighs. your cool fingers will close my eyes. lets not talk about. the passing time. But whatever is behind the door. there is nothing much to do. angel or devil I dont care. for in front of that door. there is you. My death waits. among the falling leaves. in magicians, mysterious sleeves. rabbits, dogs. and the passing time. My death waits. among the flowers. where the blackest shadow cowers. lets pick lilacs. for the passing time. My death waits in. a double bed. sails of oblivion at my head. pull up the sheets. against the passing time. But whatever is behind the door. there is nothing much to do. angel or devil I dont care. for in front of that door. there is you. Now it begins, now thats youve gone. Needles and pins, twilight till dawn. Watching the clock till you return. Lighting that torch and watching it burn. Now it begins, day after day. This is my life, ticking away. Waiting to hear footsteps that say. Love will appear and this time to stay. Each time you go. I try to pretend. Its over at last. And this time the big hurt will end. Now it begins, now thats youve gone. Needles and pins, twilight till dawn. But if you dont come back again. Ill wonder when, oh when will it end. The Big Hurt. The Big Hurt. The Big Hurt. Mist falls and his voice cracks from the morning. Flowers and my body feels like lead. Someone should have stopped the birds from singing today. Hammers from striking nails into clay. Her face penetrates the blue gray morning. Her eyes pregnant pools produce a tear. Someone should have shouted you had gone in her ear. That summer was stolen away. Such a small love. Such a little tear. You would laugh so loud. If you could see us here. With my one suit. Badly pressed and worn. Like a child left. In the world alone. He speaks I dont hear a word hes saying. Hang on to the pine trees and the snow. Reach out grab the memories that are left for your hand. Theyll help you get by for a while. Such a small love. Such a little tear. Is this all thats left. On your cheek so pale. His shallow half lit eyes. His rotted teeth grown on. Our drunken madman nights. Ending up in jail. Midnight mornings. Drenched in dayglo red. Words colliding. Things we left unsaid. Perfumed pillows. Girls that clung so near. Such a small love. Such a little tear. Move over sun. And give some sky. Ive got me some wings. Im eager to try. I may be unknown. But wait til Ive flown. Youre gonna hear from me. Make me some room. You people up there. On top of the world. Ill meet you, I swear. Im staking my claim. Remember my name. Youre gonna hear from me. Fortune smiles. On the road before me. Im fortunes child. Listen world you cant ignore me. Ive got a song. That wants to be played. Raise up a flag. Begin my parade. Then watch the world over. Start coming up clover. That how its gonna be. Youll see. Youre gonna hear from me. Through a long and sleepless night. I whisper your name. Through a long and sleepless night. Of who is to blame. Cant help but wonder. If youre lonely too. As I lie here and toss about. So at a loss without you. How I wish, my heart would leave. My memories alone. Why must I redream, relive. The Joys we have known. I pray that someday. Our love will see the light. Till then. In ticktock silence. Ill beg my heart to weep less. All through an oh so long and sleepless night. I pray that someday. Our love will see the light. Till then. In ticktock silence. Ill beg my heart to weep less. All through an oh so long and sleepless night. What was it like when we were young. Sleeping in each others arms. Walking in each others dreams. Was it only yesterday. Ive forgotten anyway. What was it like to hear your name. Wheres the girl that I once knew. Running home thru winter parks. Arm in Arm and heart in heart. Now like children in the dark. We hold hands and watch the rain. When you kissed my eyes awake. Running mornings crowded streets. Just to find weve missed our bus. but wed laugh, kiss, what the hell. When youd burst in from the rain. Clasp my head between your hands, kiss away the darkest day. Always there to understand. You could make me proud again. Now I go aimlessly at night. Sleep with faces I dont know. Always coming back to you. and the shadows of this room. I must search you eyes again. Just to find that they are dead. Always coming back to you. In the port of Amsterdam theres a sailor who sings. Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea. In the port of Amsterdam theres a sailor who sleeps. While the riverbank weeps with the old willow tree. In the port of Amsterdam theres a sailor who dies. Full of beer, full of cries in a drunken down fight. And in the port of Amsterdam theres a sailor whos born. On a muggy hot morn by the dawns early light. In the port of Amsterdam where the sailors all meet. Theres a sailor who eats only fishheads and tails. He will show you his teeth that have rotted too soon. That can swallow the moon, that can haul up the sails. And he yells to the cook with his arms open wide. Bring me more fish put it down by my side. Then he wants so to belch but hes too full to try. So he gets up and laughs and he zips up his fly. In the port of Amsterdam you can see sailors dance. Paunches bursting their pants grinding women to paunch. Theyve forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croaks. Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes. And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust. Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts. Then out to the night with their pride in their pants. With the slut that they tow underneath the street lamps. In the port of Amsterdam theres a sailor who drinks. And he drinks and he drinks and he drinks once again. He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam. Who have promised their love to a thousand other men. Theyve bargained their bodies and their virtue long gone. For a few dirty coins, and when he cant go on. He plants his nose in the sky and he wipes it up above. And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love. In the port of Amsterdam. In the port of Amsterdam. And if one day I should become. A singer with a Spanish bum. Who sings for women of great virtue. Id sing to them with a guitar. I borrowed from a coffee bar. Well, what you dont know doesnt hurt you. My name would be Antonio. And all my bridges I would burn. And when I gave them some theyd know. Id expect something in return. Id have to get drunk every night. And talk about virility. With some old grandmother. That might be decked out like a christmas tree. And though pink elephants Id see. Though Id be drunk as I could be. Still I would sing my song to me. About the time they called me Jacky. If I could be for only an hour. If I could be for an hour every day. If I could be for just one little hour. Cute in a stupid ass way. And if I joined the social whirl. Became procurer of young girls. Then I would have my own bordellos. My record would be number one. And Id sell records by the ton. All sung by many other fellows. My name would then be handsome Jack. And Id sell boats of opium. Whisky that came from Twickenham. Authentic queers. And phony virgins. If I had banks on every finger. A finger in every country. And every country ruled by me. Id still know where Id want to be. Locked up inside my opium den. Surrounded by some china men. Id sing the song that I sang then. About the time they called me Jacky. If I could be for only an hour. If I could be for an hour every day. If I could be for just one little hour. Cute in a stupid ass way. Now, tell me, wouldnt it be nice. That if one day in paradise. Id sing for all the ladies up there. And they would sing along with me. And we be so happy there to be. Cos down below is really nowhere. My name would then be Junipher. Then I would know where I was going. And then I would become all knowing. My beard so very long and flowing. If I became deaf, dumb and blind. was If I could play deaf, dumb and blind. Because I pitied all mankind. And broke my heart to make things right. I know that every single night. When my angelic work was through. The angels and the Devil too. Would sing my childhood song to me. About the time they called me Jacky. If I could be for only an hour. If I could be for an hour every day. If I could be for just one little hour. Cute in a stupid ass way. Best Of Both Worlds, Thats what you want. All your own way, Thats not my way. And I wont share you, I couldnt fare to. Its time for you to choose.

Please understand, That the black sheep can wear the golden fleece, And hold a winning hand. Im the familys unknown boy. Golden curls and envied hair. Pretty girls with faces fair. See the shining Black Sheep Boy. Hello Mr. Big Shot. Say, youre looking smart. Ive had a tiring day. I took the kids along to the park. Youve become a stranger. Every night with the boys. Got a new suit. That old smiles come back. And I kiss the children good night. And I slip away on the newly waxed floor. Ive become a giant. I fill every street. I dwarf the rooftops. I hunchback the moon. Stars dance at my feet. Leave it all behind me. Screaming kids on my knee. And the telly swallowing me. And the neighbor shouting next door. And the subway trembling the rollerskate floor. I seek the buildings blazing with moonlight. In Channing Way. Their very eyes seem to suck you in with their laughter. They seem to say. Youre all right now. So stop a while behind our smile. In Channing Way. Oh to die of kisses. Ecstasies and charms. Pavements of poets will write that I died. In nine angels arms. And they all were smiling. Still seductive as sin in their eyes. The man I had been. No more hard luck stories to wear. Nothing left to give. Why the hell should I care. Ann owns my smile and Marys my shadow. In Channing Way. And with her cellophane sighs. Celina the candle. Begs me to stay. Youre all right now. So stop a while behind our smile. In Channing Way. Naked as sin, an army towel. Covering my belly. Some of us blush, somehow. Knees turning to jelly. Next, next. I was still just a kid. There were a hundred like me. I followed a naked body. A naked body follwed me. next, next. I was still just a kid. When my innocence was lost. In a mobile army whorehouse. Gift from the army, free of cost. Next, next. Me, I really would have liked. A little touch of tenderness. Maybe a word, a smile. An hour of happiness. But, next, next. Oh, it wasnt so tragic. The high heavens did not fall. But how much of that time. I hated being there at all. Next, next Now I always will recall. The brothel truck, the flying flags. The queer lieutenant who slapped. Our asses as if we were fags. Next, next. I swear on the wet head. Of my first case of gonorrhea. It is his ugly voice. That I forever hear. Next, next. That voice that stinks of whiskey. Of corpses and of mud. It is the voice of nations. It is the thick voice of blood. Next, next. And since the each woman. I have taken to bed. Seems to laugh in my arms. To whisper through my head. Next, next. All the naked and the dead. Should hold each others hands. As they watch me scream at night. In a dream no one understands. Next, next. And when I am not screaming. In a voice grown dry and hollow. I stand on endless naked lines. Of the following and the followed. Next, next. One day Ill cut my legs off. Or burn myself alive. Anything, Ill do anything. To get out of line to survive. Never to be next. Never to be next. Suffocating eyes and fast hellos and last goodbyes. Surround the night of me. Mustache large like smoke from his cigar. Coughs up a joke and laughs a net of sound. Swallowing the pinwheel clowns. Consuming all the women. Like a giant sponge. Snap! The waiters animate. Luxuriate like planets whirling round the sun. Collapsing next to me. Shouts dont look sad. Things arent so bad. Theyre just more wrong than right. His brandy brimmed voice whispers. Come with me I hold the key. The citys ours tonight. Pays the barmaid, slaps her ass. She shrieks her gold teeth flash. With rapturous delight. Earthquaking the sawdust ground. He grabs my arm and out into the famished night. Now two blazing leaves burning up ground. The tiny waltz of a merry go round. Cascading lights for every heartbeat. Tonight well sleep with the girls from the streets. Hurry faster dont look back. His coattails snap his laughters burning in my ears. I ride upon this giant storm. Through rustred rooms where shadows breathe from every board. The world is up for auction sales. A thousand lies descend. The womens teartracked cheeks. Still well dance them on and on. We cant stop now. Not now until we reach the dawn. Quick give us your lips. Give us your thighs. Give us your sad and devouring eyes. Cascading tears for every heartbeat. Tonight well sleep with the girls from the streets. Over the rooftop sails Billy. A string tied to his underwear. Through cobbled stone streets a child races. And shouts Billy, come down from there. My mothers calling his voice whimpers. A string clutched in his tiny hand. Not till Ive seen the skys not lit up. In tears, child try and understand. Dont pull the string, Dont bring me down. Dont make me land. Plastic palace people. Sing silent songs, they dream too long. Their memories just stare. Plastic palace Alice. She steals the cards tomorrow deals. With deafening despair. Hurry, youve got to get in line. Your nose might start to shine. And sweat it out and dance about. The whole eternal life. A harvest of stars surrounds Billy. The night clings to his happy eyes. Asleep in town square beneath a fountain. A child murmurs a weary sigh. My mother weeps, And weaves her hair. With worries please, Come down from there. Plastic palace people. Through fields of clay and granite grey. They play without a sound. Plastic palace Alice. Blows gaping holes to store her fears. Inside her lovers head. Listen, theyre laughing in the halls. They rip your face with lies. To buzzing eyes you cry for help. Like gods they bark replies. Over the rooftops burns Billy. Balloon sadly the string descends. Searching its way down through blue submarine air. The polka dot underwear. To meet the trees, In morning square. Just hanging there, Just hanging there. ho cares how cold and grey. The day may be. Wait until dark. And well be warm. Our place of love. Is where we face our dreams. Together. Where our fantasies take form. When I cant feel your nearness. In the night. My disappointments disappear. A cheerless day may bring us. Little dreams. That seem to miss their mark. But oh my darling. Wait until dark. A cheerless day may bring us. Little dreams. That seem to miss their mark. But oh my darling. Wait until dark. The girls. Are as fast as a game. Are as bright as a flame. And youre always to blame. The girls. Are as pink as the light. And as dark as the night. And theyre always right. The girls. Are as cold as the sphinx. Always dreaming of minks. They drive you to drink. The girls. Are as soft as a sigh. That whispers goodbye. And leaves you to cry. But the dogs. Well, theyre only dogs. Just wagging their tails. As they watch it end. Oh, the dogs. Well, theyre only dogs. And maybe thats why. Theyre mans best friend. The girls. Can make you feel cold. Can make you feel old. An antique to be sold. The girls. They play with your heart. They tear you apart. Youre never too smart. The girls. They throw you from towers. Theyll whip you with flowers. It depends on the hours. The girls. Will treat you like trash. Or let you be brash. It depends on your cash. But the dogs. Dont depend on a thing. They just lick your face. When they see it end. Oh, the dogs. Dont depend on a thing. And maybe thats why. Theyre mans best friend. The girls. You know that they are vain. They will poison your brain. They will drive you insane. The girls. Will laugh at your jokes. How they love the coat on. But it is all a hoax. The girls. Are still making dates. they still making you wait. and they say you are late. The girls. Are yours for a throw. At least you think so. Ah but you will never know. The dogs. Well you know the dogs. They lift up a leg. As they see it end. The dogs. Well you know the dogs. And maybe thats why. Theyre mans best friend. The girls. Theyre not what they seem. They all have a scheme. They call it a dream. The girls. Are as hot as they please. And youre down on your knees. With the greatest of ease. The girls. Say youre on the right track. Then they take it all back. Tie it up in a sack. The girls. They will give it of course. But they give with such force. That it gives you remorse. But the dogs. They give nothing at all. They just lift a leg. As they watch it end. Oh, the dogs. They give nothing at all. And thats the reason why. Theyre mans best friend. And yet its because of the girls. When theyve knocked us about. And our tears want to shout. That we kick the dogs out. The windows of the world are covered with rain. Where is the sunshine we once knew. Everybody knows when little children play. They need a sunny day to grow straight and tall. Let the sunshine through. The windows of the world are covered with rain. When will those black skies turn to blue. Everybody knows when boys grow into men. They start to wonder when their country will call. Let the sunshine through. The windows of the world are covered with rain. What is the whole world coming to. Everybody knows when men can not be friends. Their quarter loves an ends. Some have to die, some have to die. Let the sunshine through. The windows of the world are covered with rain. There must be something we can do. Everybody knows whenever rain appears. Its really angel tears. How long must they cry. Ive watched her from the river banks. I knew her when she danced with dreams. White doves were there to dress her hair. And so was Madelaine. At night the peoples faces danced. Like pearls colliding on the breast. Of fat Marie whose thunder laugh. Was just a thread from crying. Her sailors stained her cobblestones. With wine and piss and death desire. And sometimes blood for Madelaine. Whose laughter was the night. Her girls would lift their dresses high. and breathe the stars and kiss the sky. Shed smother them with whispers then. Embrace them with her sighs. Before the bottle dulled my eyes. And made me so I couldnt stand. Id overact and play the clown. When Madelaine would cry. And now I watch from riverbanks. I watch it weave its memories. White doves turned gray and flew away. And so did Madelaine. Come Next Spring. When all the world is new. And fresh. And green. And fair. Then Ill come home. And Ill carry in my heart. Just one prayer. That Ill find room. Still waiting for my arms. Well meet. Well kiss. Well cling. And then once more. Love will blossom as before. Come. Come on next spring. And then once more. Love will blossom as before. Come next. Next spring. Come next spring. Its raining today. and Im just about to forget the train window girl. That wonderful day we met. She smiles through the smoke from my cigarette. Its raining today. But once there was summer and you. And dark little rooms. And sleep in late afternoons. Those moments descend on my windowpane. Ive hung around too long. Listenin to the old landladys hardluck stories. You out of me, me out of you. We go like lovers. To replace the empty space. Repeat our dreams to someone new. Its raining today. And I watch the cellophane streets. No hangups for me. Cause hangups need company. The street corner girls a cold trembling leaf. Its raining today. Its raining today. Hope for me, I hope for you, Were snowdrops falling through the night. Well melt away before we land, Two teardrops for somebodys hand. Follow me into just one more Spring. Copenhagen, youre the end, Gone and made me a child again. Warmed my feet beneath cold sheets, Dyed my hair with your sunny streets. Children arent afraid to love. And laugh when life amuses them. And our love is an antique song. For childrens carousels. Voices from a photograph. Laugh from your wall. Scream through your dreams. Wake up Rosemary and wipe your teary eyes. Rise and cross the cold bare floor. And watch the moon through frosted glass. Damn that photograph. Ill have to take it down. She hears the boats as they move down the river. She sees a dog straining hard on his leash to get away. She hears the clock and it strikes like a hammer. Pounding the nails one day further in the coffin of her. youth. Evenings with your mothers friends. Pregnant eyes, sagging chins. Swollen fingertips. Pour antique cups of tea. Who are you and where you been?. Suspended in a weightless wind. Watching trains go by. From platforms in the rain. Look at the photograph. Dream back last summer. Dream back the lips. Of that traveling salesman, Mr. Jim. He smelled of miracles. With stained glass whispers. You loved his laughter. You tremble beneath him once again. Thats what I want. A new shot at life. But my coats too thin. My feet wont fly. And I watch the wind and I see another dream blowin by. She stands all alone. You can hear her hum softly. From her fire escape in the sky. She fills the bags neath her eyes. With the moonbeams. And cries cause the worlds passed her by. Didnt time sound sweet yesterday?. In a world filled with friends. You lose your way. Shes a haunted house. And her windows are broken. And the sad young mans gone away. Her bathrobes torn. And tears smudge her lipstick. And the neighbors just whisper all day. Didnt time sounds sweet yesterday?. In a world filled with friends. You lose your way. We came through. We came riding through like warriors from afar. Our black horses danced upon the graves of yesterdays desires. Haunted by our visions framed in fire. I greet you, for you still believe in whats behind the door. Youve seen the children freeze upon their knees. And praying to the wind. To send their grey madonnas back again. Fire the guns, and salute the men who died for freedoms sake. And well weep tonight, but we wont lie awake. Gazing up at statues dressed in stars. We wont dream, for they dont come true for us. Not anymore. Theyve run afar to hide in caves. With haggard burning eyes. Their icy voices tear our hearts like knives. We came through. Like the Gothic monsters perched on Notre Dame. We observe the naked souls of gutters pouring forth mankind. Smothered in an avalanche of time. And were giants as we watch our kings and countries raise their shields. And Guevara dies encased in his ideals. And as Luther Kings predictions fade from view. We came through. Theres a butterfly circling the beach. Searching the rocks where you are. He chooses your hair, and thats where he belongs. For hes lost like a star. Head down, reluctant and warm. You give your thoughts to the sea. Dark rivers your eyes belong to noone. Like a star. Like a butterfly. They spoke transparent phrases to looking glass women. And they took the detours that scattered the way. They departed from summer like two ragged soldiers. Dragging their heels through their fantasies. There were meals in the missions for two frozen statues. And long draughty sermons devouring their knees. Sometimes passions in winter turn to cold soundless moments. That teared in the eyes of their fantasies. There were nights on park benches, stale bread for the pigeons. Good mornings to faces who just turned away. And on one road confusion, the other desire. So they took to the road of their fantasies. One would speak of a lake where he used to go swimming. The other had no memories left for his mind. With their arms round each other the two ragged soldiers. Laughed through a war that they couldnt see. Laughed for a world filled with fantasy. See the dwarves and see the giants. Which one would you choose to be?. And if you cant get that together. Heres the answer, heres the key. You can freeze like a Century Man. Like a Century Man. Ill save my bread and take it with me. Til a hundred years or so. Shame you wont be there to see me. Shakin hands with Charles De Gaulle. Play it cool and Saranwrap all you can. Be a Century Man. You can freeze like a Century Man. Like a Century Man. Like a Century Man. Youre like a winter night. Your thoughts are frozen. You kiss your lovers. In the snow. Too many icy tears. Glisten for someone. You watch the leaves. As they shiver your loneliness. Your eyes are lanterns. Growing dim. I hum inside. Like the meadows in summer. But Ill never light them up. Again. Two weeks since youve gone. And I feel like the tramp. Picking dustbins in the alley. He looks up as I pass. Clutching rags from a citys restless night. I could read all my sadness. In faces I knew. Down at Kellys bar last Friday. And I havent been back since I mistook. Somebody for a friend. And if I walk these streets long enough. Will you happen to me again?. With whom are you sharing. The sweet taste of summer?. My memories pursue you. Like puddles of rain. The river inside me still flow. To the sea of your hands. And if I close my eyes for a while. Will you happen to me again?. Sons of the thief, sons of the saint. Who is the child with no complaint. Sons of the great or sons unknown. All were children like your own. The same sweet smiles, the same sad tears. The cries at night, the nightmare fears. Sons of the great or sons unknown. All were children like your own. So long ago long, long, ago. But sons of tycoons or sons of the farms. All of the children ran from your arms. Through fields of gold, through fields of ruin. All of the children vanished too soon. In towring waves, in walls of flesh. Among dying birds trembling with death. Sons of tycoons or sons of the farms. All of the children ran from your arms. So long ago long, long, ago. But sons of your sons or sons passing by. Children we lost in lullabies. Sons of true love or sons of regret. All of the sons you cannot forget. Some built the roads, some wrote the poems. Some went to war, some never came home. Sons of your sons or sons passing by. Children we lost in lullabies. So long ago long, long, ago. But, sons of the theif, sons of the saint. Who is the child with no complaint. Sons of the great or sons unknown. All were children like your own. The same sweet smiles, the same sad tears. The cries at night, the nightmare fears. Sons of the great or sons unknown. All were children like your own. Oh I can see them now. Clutching a hankerchief. And blowing me a kiss. Discreetly asking how. How came he died so young. Or was he very old. Is the body still warm. Or is it already cold. All doors are open wide. They grope around inside. At my desk my drawers my trunk. Theres nothing left to hide. Some love letters are there. And an old photograph. Theyve laid my poor soul bare. And now all they do is laugh. Oh I can see them all. So formal and so stiff. Like a sergeant at arms. At a policemans ball. And everybodys pushing. To be the first in line. Their hearts upon their sleeves. Like a ten cent valentine. The old women are there. Too old to give a damn. Theyve brought along the kids. Who dont know who I am. Theyre thinking about the price of my funeral bouquet. What theyre thinking isnt nice. For now theyll have to pay. Oh I see all of you. All of my phoney friends. Who cant wait for it ends. Who cant wait till its through. Oh I see all of you. Youve been laughing all these years. Now all that you have left. Are a few crocodile tears. Ah you dont even know. That youre entering your hell. As you leave my cemetary. You think youre doing well. With that one whos at your side. Youre as proud as you can be. Ah shes going to make you cry. But not the way you cried for me. Oh I can see me now. So cold and so alone. As the flowers slowly die. In my field of little bones. Oh I can see me now. I can see me at the end. Of this voyage that Im on. Without a love without a friend. Now all this that I see. Is not what I deserve. They really have a nerve. To say these things to me. No girls just bread and water. And your money you must save. For therell be nothing left for us. When youre dead and in your grave. If you go away. On this summer day. Then you might as well. Take the sun away. All the birds that flew. In the summer sky. When our love was new. And our hearts were high. And the day was young. And the night was long. And the moon stood still. For the night birds song. If you go away. But if you stay. Ill make you a day. Like no day has been. Or will be again. Well sail the sun. Well ride on the rain. And talk to the trees. And worship the wind. Then if you go. Ill understand. Leave me just enough love. To fill up my hand. If you go away. As I know you will. You must tell the world. To stop turning, turning. til you return again. If you ever do. For what good is love. Without loving you?. Can I tell you now. As you turn to go. Ill be dying slowly. til the next hello. But if you stay. Ill make you a night. Like no night has been. Or will be again. Ill sail on your smile. Ill glide on your touch. Ill talk to your eyes. That I love so much. But if you go. I wont cry. Though the good is gone. From the word goodbye. If you go away. As I know you must. Therell be nothing left. In this world to trust. Just an empty room. Full of empty space. Like the empty look. I see on your face. And Id have been the shadow. Of your shadow. If it might have kept me. By your side. Anybody seen a knight pass this way. I saw him playing chess with Death yesterday. His crusade was a search for God and they say. Its been a long way to carry on. Anybody hear of plague in this town. The town Ive left behind was burned to the ground. A young girl on a stake her face framed in flames cried. Im not a witch God knows my name. The knight he watched with fear. He needed to know. He ran where he might feel Gods breath. And in the misty church. He knelt to confess. The face within the booth was Mr. Death. My lifes a vain pursuit of meaningless smiles. Why cant God touch me with a sign. Perhaps theres no one there answered the booth. And Death hid within his cloak and smiled. This morning I played chess with Death said the knight. We played that he might grant me time. My bishop and my knight will shatter his flanks. And still I might feel Gods heart in mine. And through confessions grille Deaths laughter was heard. The knight cried No youve cheated me!. But still Ill find a way. Well meet once again and once again. Continue to play. They met within the woods the knight his squire and friends. And Death said now the game shall end. The final move was made. The knight hung his head. And said youve won Ive nothing left to play. The minstrel filled with visions sang to his love. To look against the stormy sky. The knight his squire and friends. Their hands held as one. Solemnly danced toward the dawn. His hourglass in his hand his scythe by his side. The master Death he leads them on. The rain will wash away the tears from their faces. And as the thunder cracked they were gone. Wasnt it a good year. Wasnt filled with talking. It still moves through my heart. From time to time. City after city. Granite gray as morning. Heroes died in subways left behind. far behind like our love. Youre on your own again. And youre your best again. Thats what you tell yourself. I see it all the way. as far as anyone can see. Except when it began. I was so happy I didnt feel like me. As the morning turned my way. See birds flying through this hazy face. And I came back here to replace your place in my life. And didnt you know that Im not the worlds strongest man. When it comes to you and your world Im lost. Cant you see the towers of mine they could shine like a dime. Take me back again to your warm design. And again again again. Longing for belongings here again. And I need your love you know I cant pretend anymore. And didnt you know that Im not the worlds strongest man. When it comes to you and your world Im lost. Cant you see the towers of mine they could shine like a dime. Take me back again to your warm design. The Angels of Ashes. Will give back your passions. Again and again. Their light shafts. Will reach through the darkness. And touch you my friend. Theyll fly in a mind dance. And blind you with wings. Wrapped in flame. If youre down to an echo. They just might remember. Your name. In the unbroken darkness. Where emptiness empties. Alone. Theres no starting or stopping. Where there is no right or. No wrong. Well thats all right for some. Who can hang the absurd. On their wall. If your blind hands cant grope. Through these measureless waters. Youll fall. Youve been following patterns. And fleeting sensations. Too long. And the fullness that fills up. The pulse of durations. Is gone. Let the great constellation. Of flickering ashes. Be heard. Let them burn with a fire. All it takes to confess. Is a word, just a word. I can recommend angels. Ive watched as theyve made a man strong. Oh so strong. If your humbleness shows. Then Im sure that theyll take you. Along. You can tell them who sent you. It might help to get you. Above. You can say that he laughed. And he walked like St. Francis. With love. Youll lose your way. A boy child rides upon your back. Take him away. Through mirrors dark and blessed with cracks. Through forgotten courtyards. Where you used to search for youth. Old gets a new life. Reach out you can touch its true. Hes not a shadow of shadows. Like you, you see. Hearts hold on holding. If you stay one, youll stay free. Go seek the lady. Who will give, not take away. Naked with stillness. On the edge of dawn she stays. Night starts to empty. Thats when her song begins. Shell make you happy. Shell take you deep within. Window lights for wanderers. Hide hard in your swollen eyes. Echoes of laughter. Hide in the cities thighs. Love catch these fragments. Swirling through the winds of night. What can it cost. To give a boy child back his sight. Extensions through dimensions. Leave you feeling cold and lame. Boy child mustnt tremble. cos he came without a name. Hes a hero of the war. All the neighborhood is talkin bout your son. Mrs. Reiley get his medals. Hand them round to everyone. Show his gun to all the children in the street. Its too bad he cant shake hands or move his feet. Hes a hero of the war. You can see his picture in the local news. Mrs. Reiley seems the girl next door is nowhere to be found. Once you couldnt keep that boy from hangin round. Never mind dear, youre with your mum once more. Hes a hero of the war. Like his dad he gave his life the war before. It was tragic how you almost died of pain when he was born. With no husband there beside you through it all. Ring the bell if you get hungry or you fall. Youre a hero of the war. Why those teardrops on your cheek? its so absurd. Feelin empty its the emptiness of heroes like your son. And what made him leave his mother for a gun. Driven forward driven back and nothing more. Hes a hero of the war. I seen a hand, I seen a vision. It was reaching through the clouds, To risk a dream. A shadow crossed the sky. And it crushed into the ground, Just like a beast. The old mans back again. The old mans back again. I seen a woman, standing in the snow. She was silent as she watched them take her man. Teardrops burned her cheeks. for she thought shed heard, The shadow had left this land. The old mans back again. The old mans back again. The crowds just gathered, their faces turned away. And they queue all day like dragons of disgust. All the women whispering. Wondering just what these young hotheads want of us. And entres vie he cries. with eyes that ring like chimes. His antiworlds go spinning through his head. He burns them in his dreams. for half awake they may as well be dead. The old mans back again. I see hes back again. I see a soldier, Hes standing in the rain. For him theres no old man to walk behind. Devoured by his pain. bewildered by the faces who pass him by. Hed like another name the one hes gots a curse. These people cried. Why cant they understand. His mother called him Ivan then she died. The old mans back again. The old mans back again. I can see him back again. Its your bicycle bells and your Rembrandt swells. Your children alive and still breathing. And your look of loss when youre coming across. Makes me feel like a thief when youre bleeding. Duchess Duchess. Light up your candles for me. Duchess Duchess. Put all your love back in me. I come listening I touch touching. With the Persian sea running through your veins. You shed your names with the seasons. Still they all return with the last remains. And they lay them before you like reasons. With your shimmering dress it says no it says yes. It says Ive nothing left for conceiving. Its your shiftless flesh and your old girls grace. Its your young girls face that Im breathing. Duchess Duchess. Light up your candles for me. Duchess Duchess Duchess. Put all the love back in me. I am lying she is crying. Its the signs as we see them. Theres no thresholds at all. Theres no vows to be broken. As we rise, or we fall. Theres no noise high above us. As the moon turns in space. Just the face of a lady. Who we loved for her grace. Get behind me, Get behind me. Wont you bend my ear again. I really need a friend. Get behind me, Get behind me. Remind me to remind me. Not to go back there again. When the threads of dark moments. Start to tremble with sound. And an almost formed whisper dies. The boundaries surround. We keep reaching beyond us. Through the shape shifting clouds. Why aint I like you brother, So electric, so proud. Get behind me, Get behind me. Wont you bend my ear again. I really need a friend. Get behind me, Get behind me. Remind me to remind me. Not to go back there again. Set us free of this feeling. So well be once again. So we wont feel the gravity of time. And the face in the faces. Of the loves we move through. Reappears in original design. Get behind me, Get behind me. Wont you bend my ear again. I really need a friend. Get behind me, Get behind me. Remind me to remind me. Not to go back there again. Ive come from far from chains, From metal and stone, From makeshift designs, And seeking a star. To grab for the truth, To keep myself warm, I turn and its gone, You smile and its born. The rhymes of a womans, A river that never ends. The Rhymes of Dimension, Surrounds us with fire and friends, And roaring through darkness, The Night children fly, I still hear them singing the rhymes of goodbye. Theres nothing within, but within says a voice, Thats still my Empire, And Ive got a choice. Its healers of death, Its still got a fire, And I keep it burning, With hands of desire. The bells of our senses, Can cost us our pride, Can toll out the boundaries, That level our lives. Can slash like the sunlight, Through shadows and cracks, Our nakedness calling, Our nakedness back. The rhyme of our passions, Find beauty in loving love, The rhyme of our madness, Burn cities and pushnshoves, And roaring through darkness, The Night children fly, I still hear them singing the rhymes of goodbye. Its on days like these. When your brother falls. You can read it all in the Times. How a moving car. Stole a movie star. Little Things that keep us together. While the wars going on. Its on days like these. When your childhood cries. And you see it all on the news. Little children starve. Growing tired of born. Little things that keep us all close and warm. While the wars going on. Find a place you can hide. And take what you can. The time will arrive. When you need a friend. Stop looking at us. Were waving goodbye. Theres a man. Shouting hes with me. When that morning comes. I cant wait to see. Just how high his eagle. On color screens. Is gonna fly. Going to fly. Its on nights like these. That your neighbor dies. Cos he put a gun to his head. He was so alone. He had nothing left. Little things that call for a drink. That bury a soldiers death. Its on days like these. When your sister cries. And your brother falls from your hands. Jumbo jets can die. Killing Little things that help us get by the why. Why the wars going on. Why the wars going on. Why the war is going on. why the war is going on. why the wars going on. why the wars going on. As old Joe sat a dyin. The baby down the hall was cryin. Somebody had a party goin on. The fat boy you told tales to. Moved away the other day. To think with no goodbye. He could have gone. A postcard from Sun City. Was found layin by your side. A kind of desert place. Where old folks dry away. You gazed out through the window. At the wonders of the sky. As if it were the first time every day. There aint noone left alive to call me Joe. You used to say. Noone left alive. To call me Joe. Youve been beyond the boundaries. Understood it all. And thought of nothing. The ultimate was simple to your eyes. Just watch the world make madness. As the youth cried their replies. An old man knows far better than to try. They say towards the end. You hardly left your shabby room. Where once you loved to go. Walkin. Thru the day. Sit back and watch a spider. Weave your window. Cross the moon. And meals on wheels. Laughed kindly. When youd say. There aint noone left alive to call me Joe. To call me Joe. Noone left alive to call me Joe. You always said I wouldnt stay. I guess you saw the way. Before it all began. Ive always been a changin train. And when you think on this. You might forgive me then. Thanks for Chicago Mr James. And all the shiny suits. And all the shining names. The things a country boy cant grace. Without the look of shame. Upon a city face. And you needed more. Than the smile I wore. You picked me up on my way down. The dusty one horse town. I wont forget the jail. The mayors wife and Cadillac. The sheriff on my back. Til you put up the bail. Thanks for Chicago Mr James. You got a lot of grace. But youre an empty place. The dawn falls hard upon my face. Ill move as I began. Thru fields without a plan. Thanks for Chicago Mr James. That world of grey and gold. That watched you growing old. The things I never saw I see. To think that Im still free. And Im not feeling cold. Long about now. Hes heading home. Back from the rain. Burned to the ground. His ashes will rise black butterflies. Tapping at my window pane. Hell want to rest within my design. All the way to the end. Lighting my skies all up inside again. Dimming Summer. Long about now. Hes headin home. Drowning the games. That steel a man. Long about now. Hell shrug and sigh and need me again. Moon breathin in thru my window. Curtains are sighing dust of the day. Still Im not alone like all my neighbours say. Time Operator. Take the time to take the time. To come over here. We got so much in common. Seems its hard for us to sleep. With all the razzle dazzle in the street. The man come to shut off my water. The man come to shut down my lights yesterday. Im not one to moan. I made the bill for the telephone. Now I wouldnt care if youre ugly. Cos here with the lights out I couldnt see. You just picture Paul Newman. And girl he looks a lot like me. Time Operator. Take the time to take the time. To come over here. We got so much in common. Seems its hard for us to sleep. With all the razzle dazzle in the street. Whatever happened to Jean the machine. She used to live down the hall from me. And all of the boys in the band. Miss her so bad now. Aint it pitiful. She made her way from Hungary. A refugee with a voice like Callas. But somehow she couldnt get on. So she took it off. At the, the local Palace. Jean come back Whyd you go now. Jean come back Things are slow now. Jean come back. My landlady said Jeans a commie spy. And each time I asked for the reason why. My landlady said its a front. She bumps and grinds codes. To an audience of immigrants. It blows my mind when I think of Jean. Every night with a new routine. Cos I play drums in the band. She used me as part. Of her dirty commie plan. Jean come back we forgive you. Jean come back boy scouts honour. Jean come back Spiro Agnew. Jean come back To the Bolshoi. Jean come back To your homeland. Jean come back bring the microfilm. Andrea turn to me and hear what Im sayin. And why must you always be kneelin and prayin. Though hard as I run. I cant overcome. The things that this city has taken. Cowbells shakin. Go back to our village awailin and weepin. And tell your fat momma the life weve been keepin. Your head waiter brother wont give me a job. And Ive walked these streets till Im breakin. Cowbells shakin. Andrea speak up cant you hear what Im sayin. And why must you always be kneelin and prayin. Here on the outskirts of life. Its a world with the voice of a caretakers wife. Im leaving tomorrow dont let it bring you down. Stick around and around and around and around. Til the band comes in. And the clouds begin to open. Til the band comes in. And we hear them all as one. Ill be back again. If you promise that youll write me. Til the band comes rollin in. Keep your friends. With their windows so high. Keep your city. With children that shine through its eye. If you need me to move thru. You know where Im found. Still alive with my subhuman sound to the ground. Til the band comes in. And the clouds begin to open. Til the band comes in. And we hear them all as one. Ill be back again. If you promise that youll write me. Til the band comes rollin in. The times we sat and sang of all the hidden things we knew. Did they ever come up true. Cant remember, cant remember. And its the time to sing a song. Across the emptiness between us. And remember. Everything still. Everything silent. As after the rain. We lie here listening. To night close down. Stare like a child. Wait for the signs to decide. Once again. Just when they looked here. To stay. Were to leave. Our world arraign. It really isnt fair. Outside they sing. The war is over. Raise your blinds. The war is over. Tell your deepest dark. Goodbye. A distant waltz. Turns in the head. Of an old ladys night. Waiting hands unfold. Within the dark. Lighting her lamp. Seeing Prince Albert. Recalling the sight. They waltz again through the park. Floorboards creak. Beneath the moon. The room below just sighs. Outside they sing. The war is over. Raise your blinds. The war is over. Let me get some sleep. Tonight. Everything still. Everything silent. As after the rain. Still we are after. The rain. You were the sunshine, baby. Whenever you smiled. But I call you Stormy today. All of a sudden. That ole rains fallin down. And my world is cloudy and gray. Youve gone away. Oh Stormy, Stormy, Stormy, Stormy. Bring back that sunny day. Yesterdays love. Was like a warm summer breeze. But, just like the weather you changed. Now things are dreary, baby. And its windy and cold. And I stand alone in the rain. And Im callin your name. Yeah Stormy, Stormy, Stormy, Stormy. Bring back that sunny day. Oh, my storm. Come on back and storm. Come on back and bring back that sun again. I need you Stormy, Stormy, Stormy. Stormy. Bring it back, bring that sunny day, bring that sunny day. Bring that sunny day. Once we strolled the hills of yesterday. We are young in those hills far away. Through the good times and bad. My heart is very glad. That you and I once shared a dream so long ago. Autumn ends, a willow bends with snow. But wherever you are I must go. Take me back once again to the hills of yesterday. Where you first stole my heart away. Through the good times and bad. My heart is very glad. That you and I once shared a dream so long ago. Autumn ends, a willow bends with snow. But wherever you are I must go. Take me back once again to the hills of yesterday. Where you first stole my heart away. Reuben James, in my song you live again. And the phrases that I rhyme. Are just footsteps out of time. From the time when I first knew you Reuben James. Reuben James all the folks around Madison County. Cursed your name. Just a noaccount sharecroppin colored man. Who would steal anything he can. And they always laid the blame on Reuben James. Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind. The faded shirt, the weathered brow. The calloused hand upon the plough. I loved you then and I love you now Reuben James. Flora Gray, the gossip of Madison County died with a child. And although your skin was black. It was you that didnt turn your back. On a hungry white child with no name, Reuben James. Reuben James, with your mind on my soul. And the Bible in your right hand. You said turn the other cheek. A better world is awaiting for the meek. In my head those words remain from Reuben James. Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind. The faded shirt, the weathered brow. The calloused hand upon the plough. I loved you then and I love you now Reuben James. Reuben James one dark cloudy day. They brought you from the fields. And to your lonely pine box came. Just a preacher, me and the rain. To sing one last refrain for Reuben James. Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind. The faded shirt, the weathered brow. The calloused hand upon the plough. I loved you then and I love you now Reuben James. What are you doing the rest of your life?. North and South and East and West of your life. I have only one request of your life. That you spend it all with me. All the seasons and the times of your days. All the nickels and the dimes of your days. Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days. All begin and end with me. I want to see your face in every kind of light. In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night. And when you stand before the candles on a cake. Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make. Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes. In the world of love that you keep in your eyes. Ill awaken whats asleep in your eyes. It may take a kiss or two. Through all of my life. Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life. All I ever will recall of my life. Is all of my life with you. If time were not a moving thing. And I could make it stay. This hour of love we share. Would always be. Thered be no coming day. To shine a morning light. And make us realize our night is over. When you walk away from me. There is no place to put my hand. Except to shade my eyes against the sun. That rises over the land. I watch you walk away. Somehow I have to let you go. Cause its over. If you knew just how I really feel. You might return and yet. There are so many times. That people have to love and then forget. Oh there might have been a way somehow. I have to force myself to say. Its over. So I turn my back, Turn my collar to the wind. Move along in silence. Trying not to think at all. I set my feet before me. Walk the silent street before me. Now its over. If time were not a moving thing. And I could make you stay. This hour of love we share. Would always be. Thered be no coming day. To shine a morning light. And make us realize our night is over. Its over. This way Mary, come Mary. Share the world with me. Make this moment our moment. And our memories. This way Mary, come Mary. Let me warm your heart. Take this love I bring you. And then let forever start. This way Mary, come Mary. While the sun is high. Make this summer the summer. That refuse to die. This way Mary, run Mary. Our love had to be. So take my hand. And walk this way with me. This way Mary, come Mary. Our love has to be. So take my hand. And walk this way with me. Speak softly love, and hold me warm against your heart. I feel your words, the tender trembling moments start. Were in a world, our very own. Sharing a love that only few have ever known. Wine coloured days, warmed by the sun. Deep velvet nights, when we are one. Speak softly love, so noone hears us but the sky. The vows of love we make will live until we die. My life is yours and all because. You came into my world with love. So softly love. Wine coloured days, warmed by the sun. Deep velvet nights, when we are one. Speak softly love, so noone hears us but the sky. The vows of love we make will live until we die. My life is yours and all because. You came into my world with love. So softly. Love. Wearin my high boots. Got all my wordlies here in a sack. Looking for something. Knowing that it aint here where Im at. Im comin back Im comin. Ride by thumbin. Get by bummin, Im on my way. Friend, have you seen Glory Road?. Say friend, Ive got a heavy load. And I know Glory Roads waiting for me. Caught me a pickup down from Seattle to L.A. Seems like those folks go chasin a new star every day. Aint gonna stay in Nevada through Wyoming. Colorado Im on my way. Friend, have you seen Glory Road?. Say friend, Ive got a heavy load. And I know Glory Roads waiting for me. Its so many autumns. Which way to go? Louisiana, New York City. They wont give the answer. They ask of me. Friend, have you seen Glory Road?. Say friend, Ive got a heavy load. And I know Glory Roads waiting for me. Rest my load, now I know. Glory Road wont set me free. The snow was on the hill. The fields were soft and white. We touched and time stood still. On that hill, on that night. Your glances said begin. Begin this strange affair. Your glances begged begin. And we loved sweetly there. Time will pass, memories fade. Of a bold bizarre charade. Of a kiss in the night. Out of time, and sight. The snow was on the hill. The fields were soft and white. We touched and time stood still. On that hill. On that night. The summer smiles, the summer knows. And unashamed, she sheds her clothes. The summer smoothes the restless sky. And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie. The summer knows, the summers wise. She sees the doubts within your eyes. And so she takes her summertime. Tells the moon to wait, and the sun to linger. Twists the world round her summer finger. As you see. The wonder of it all. And if youve learned your lesson well. Theres little more for her to tell. One last caress. Its time to dress for fall. And if youve learned your lesson well. Theres little more for her to tell. One last caress. Its time to dress. For fall. Father yes, I am a prisoner. Fear not, to relate my crime. The crime is loving the forsaken. Only silence is shame. Blessed are the persecuted. And blessed are the pure in heart. Blessed are the merciful. Blessed are the ones who mourn. Give to me your tired and your poor. Your huddled masses, yearning to be free. The wretched refuge of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless. send this task to me. And now Ill tell you. Whats against us. And aught thats lived for centuries. Go through the years. And you will find. Whats blackened all. Of the history. Father, yes I am a prisoner. Only silence is. Shame. Tomorrow is a face in the crowd. A leaf in the wind. A bend in the road. Were travelling. Tomorrow is a sky filled with dreams. A gift from the moon. A sea we have yet to sail. But must very soon. Will we be there together?. We should be there together. Ive done moving alone. Through the miles of miles of yesterday. Were each of us a face in the crowd. Now you and I can share all there is between hello and. goodbye. Together we can try. Together. We can. Try. I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night. Alive as you or me. Says I But Joe, youre ten years dead. I never died, said he. I never died, said he. The copper bosses killed you, Joe. They shot you Joe, said I. Takes more than guns to kill a man. Says Joe I did not die. Says Joe I did not die. Standing there as big as life. And asmiling with his eyes. Says Joe What they can never kill. Went on to organize. Went on to organize.. From San Diego up to Maine, In every mine an mill. Where working men defend their rights,. It say Youll find Joe Hill. Its there youll find Joe Hill. Its there youll find Joe. Joe Hill, Joe Hill. Love is storm and wind, then tide. All the tears your heart can hold. But I look back after loss of love. And find the days were gone. I see only shattered skies. Not a ray of light to find. But I look back after loss of love. And sunlight blinds my mind. Songs were sung with words as young as May. But in the mist of summer, winter came. A chill blew out the flame. Now the words have haunted suns. Ring as clear as they did then. Still I look back after loss of love. And learn to love again. Songs were sung with words as young as May. But in the mist of summer, winter came. A chill blew out the flame. Now the words have haunted suns. Ring as clear as they did then. Still I look back after loss of love. And learn to love. Again. When youre standing alone. With the mountain and the ski. When the arms of the world open wide. Well, the trick is that plain as a falling rain. And youre sure as the time and the tide. You see, were all His children, His next of kin. Thats the way it began. No matter were youre going, or where you been. You are the family of Man. When you walk down a road. And the sun is on your side. With the sweet river breathes on your face. When you dont hear a sound, as you look around. Everything are to fall into place. You see, were all His children, His next of kin. Thats the way it began. No matter where youre going, or where you been. Youre part of the family of Man. You see, were all His children, His next of kin. Thats the way it began. No matter where youre going, or where you been. Youre part of the family of Man. Come Saturday Morning. Im going away with my friend. Will Saturday spend more than half of the day?. Just I and my friend. Well wander for miles. In our Saturday smiles. And then well move on. But we will remember. Long after Saturdays gone. Come Saturday morning. Im going away with my friend. Well wander for miles. In our Saturday smiles. Just I and my friend. Dressed up in our rings. And our Saturday things. And then well move on. But we will remember. Long after Saturdays gone. Easy come, easy go. Thats the way if love must have its stay. Then ours, it came. Let it go. No remorse, no regret. We should part exactly as we met. Just easy come, easy go. We never dreamt of romantic dangers. Now that it ends lets be friends. And not two strangers. Easy come, easy go. Here we are, so darling au revoir. Easy come, easy go. Throw off those gimmicks to the boys. Let them send it all up in the air. There is crouching and wailing on stone down here. We must freeze off this ratmosphere. Scraping out noise across nite wires. Runs for the distant cities. There is never a lock in the fall down here. As the big full pours away. In the shutout. In the shutout. How will we know the great doll?. Something attacked the earth last nite. With a kick that man habit eye. Cut the sleep tight boys who dreamed and dreamed. Of a city like the sky. There were faces bobbing in the heat. For some rising from her zone. Moving, hitting, holding on. For the promise to carry us home. In the shutout. In the shutout. Never a lock in the fall. In the shutout. In the shutout. How will we know the great doll?. Sunfighters locked in right angle rooms. Watch their lovers sleep face down in the yellow lite. Keep the balance on a back curve. till the war with the nite is over. The gods are gone, the air is thick. You cannot risk the fat fat mama kick. Armed angels walk the city Iites. Wait inside their master corpses peeled raw, betrayed. And fade and fade. As the noise goes over and over. The gods are gone, the searchlites lick. You cannot risk the fat fat mama kick. Theres no hold. The moving has come through. The danger brushing you. Turns its face into the heat. And runs the tunnels. Its so cold. The dark dug up by dogs. The stitches torn and broke. The raw meat fist you choke. Has hit the bloodlite. Glass traps open and close on nite flights. Broken necks, featherweights press the walls. Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights. Only one promise, only one way to fall. Glass traps open and close on nite flights. Broken necks, featherweights press the walls. Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights. Only one promise, only one way to fall. On the nite flights, on the nite flights. On the nite flights, only one way to fall. On the nite flights, on the nite flights. On the nite flights, only one way to fall. Baby, its slow. When lights go low. Theres no help, no. Baby, its slow. When lights go low. Theres no help, no. Hes drilling through the Spiritus Sanctus tonight. Through the dark hip falls. Screaming, Oh, you mambos. Kill me and kill me and kill me. If I jerk the handle. Youll die in your dreams. If I jerk the handle, jerk the handle. Youll thrill me and thrill me and thrill me. Baby, its slow. When lights go low. Theres no help, no. This is how you disappear. out between midnight, called up under valleys. of torches and stars. Foot, knee, shaggy belly, face. famous hindlegs, as one of their own. you graze with them. Cromagnon herders. will stand in the wind, sweeping tails shining, and scaled to begin, to where necks. leave the air. unpossesed. and giant heads lock. constellations. A last grain of dust. lands in the darkness. on tongues laid bare, and turning to chalk. Shutting down here. Freezing in red, bent over his ice skin, The insomniac gnaws. in the OnOffs. he is glazed. in the hooves. all round. It is losing its shape. Losing its shape, as the heat. in your hands. carve the muscle. away. And he grins. from a break. in a backflash. Delivers it up. on a break. in a backflash. Motionless brands. burn into a hipframe. As a saviour. loads sightlines. backlit by fires, on the ridges. of the highest. breeder. The windows are ringing. shaking Nightnites for angels. rattling throats up and down on a beam. Cooling the hearts. cooling the plasma. keeping ice junkies packed hard on a seam. The other side of a prowler. the dead still search the living. At least there we did not not fail. Coming to in the overcast. tracks are still flowing. At least there he does not wail. Psalms of your hands. sung into the lateness. move a circuit on the white. and he cant feel a thing. Gone always alone to all you are never. he climbs into your mouth. when the windows ring. The windows are ringing. shaking dead men for angels. Hissing brains boiling up. presst to the bone. uncoils the wire whole night long. bumping out thru the eye in knots. Sweet hot numbers. sweet hots. bumping out thru the eye. on a wire of knots. Sweet hot numbers. sweet hots. bumping out thru the eye. on a wire of knots. Psalms of your hands. sung into the lateness. move a circuit on the white. and he cant feel a thing. Gone always alone to all you are never. he climbs into your mouth. when the windows ring. Delayed in the headlong. Resembled to breakingpoint. I swear you never slept at night. when the growing is slow. After me Im no mans son. run out of recognize. The blood of our. split back without his prisoner. the distance rigged in his eyes. Rock of castoffs. bury me. hide my soul. and sink us free. Rock of cast offs. bury me. hide my soul. and pray us free. From the host of latecomers. a miracle enters the streets. shining with rain. he is shaking to wash. the murder away. The shadow of the son. made the son a shadow. its never night when I die. That desert clouds under. and so Lord lightens. sleepers wait there. with wounds in their sides. In the strength of the crime. you sing like a stranger. and your failure fulfills. your most secret defeat. After me Im no mans son. run out of recognize. A life of its own. lays down the horizon. the distance rigged in its eyes. Rock of castoffs. bury me. hide my soul. and sink us free. Rock of cast offs. bury me. hide my soul. and pray us free. In the time of an exile. from the jails of another. where soundings are taken. raw to his eyes. I have walked the way from him. down to splintering bone ashes. with your voice shining sea. in his fractures and skys. There are no voices here. There are only confessions. keeping him hidden. weighed out of his name. We have entered deserted. He has gazed from my windows. as if all that replaced us. could still end in me. For the first time unwoken. I am returned. For the first time unwoken. I am returned. He arrives from a place. with a face of fast sun. Arrives from a space. his refuge overrun. She will fold him away in his. badly changed hand. Fold him away far behind. where I am. For the first time forgetting. I am returned. As if all that replaced us ends it again. as if all that replaced us ends. Its a starving reflection. if he dies in the night. listening to the increase. It cuts out your likeness. in blood circulations. suspended beneath a release. A low volume force feed. lower than pity. slips across under the heart. and your hostage rewinding. from every eclipse. rolls in the voltage. runoff rain on his lips. We chew up the blackness. to some high sleep. travel a faster silence. One to go long again. in the going gone again. Full stare passages. striking less face. outside on the move. a shattered heart pace. greases the fade. sinking the blood back. breaking to where loaded icons wade. Eyesides catch far awake. in a cols sanctuary. Pain sonics eternities. all through themoves. A first communication. tears loose undelivered. and swims unassigned. in your dimmed latitudes. And the heat from the shore. melts down to recieve us. floodlit foreheads. howled open and so nearly blessed. as they soften round dogjoys. of unfinished strangers. rubbed out on a point. afterburning. Say it got late. on that one. That lifegiver one. Hanging weightless from the wound. in a halflight. Taken up I could hold him. when all falls away. Prayed into each other. you stood in the air. And the ceiling are rising and falling. The ceiling are shining and slow. peeling tongues from the ice hums and letting it go. And the ceiling are rising and falling. The ceiling are shining and slow. peeling tongues from the ice hums and letting it go. Stump of a drowner. The delta holder. Lowered up from his boulder. and riding pains. steady blowout. All those arms in the gullys. chewed through at the wrists. All that wont flood awake all that listens and lifts. Deserting your lead. while the figure is also carrying. Deserting your lead. while the figure is also carrying. Your hands are drained. Your skins are stained and heavy. Go to ground. you are sealed against the night. Spotted head blood head. heat up the stars. Polish and silence away your parole. Shes a dugout. her second sleeps. dreagging the roads. Her fixed strays. shine from ditches. wherever she goes Deserting your lead. while the figure is also carrying. Pry open those jaws. try and hear your own way out. Driven in deep. you save yourself the burying. The darkness swarms. Try and hear your own way out. When I crossed the river. with a heavy blanket roll. I took nobody with me. not a soul. I took a few provisions. some for comfort, some for cold. but I took nobody with me. not a soul. Do I hear. Ill give you. Do I hear. Ill give you. This night you. are mistaken.

Dipped in blood in the moonlight. Like what happen in America. This is us. Our eyesides snagged. Dipped in mob in the daylight. Like what happen in America. The breasts are still heavy. The legs long and straight. The upper lip remains short. The teeth are too small. The eyeside is green. The hair long and black. Still coming through. Still coming through. She knows this room. She can navigate it in the dark. She entered the Palazzo at night by a side door. To ascend to a lift in the upper floor. She lies on the bed. Looking up not yet seeing. The signs of the zodiac painted in gold. On the blue vaulted ceiling. His enormous eyes as he arrives. Coming nearer in the surrounding darkness. His strange beliefs about the moon. Its influence upon men of affairs. The danger of its cold light on your face. While you were sleeping. Shell eclipse it with her head. Stroke him til he sleeps. Until he has nothing to do among men of affairs. Sometime before dawn. Her bare feet cross the floor. She gazes from the window. At the fountain in the courtyard. Sometimes I feel like a swallow. A swallow which by some mistake. Has gotten into an attic. And knocks its head against the walls in terror. This is not a rabbit skinned. With a body of silver. Like what happen in America. This is not a terrapin. With its shell torn away. Like what happen in America. The breasts are still heavy. The legs long and straight. The upper lip remains short. The teeth are too small. The eyeside is green. The hair long and black. Still coming through. Still coming through. The mood soon changed. In the clear morning air. A man came up towards the body. And poked it with a stick. It rocked swiftly. And twisted around at the end of the rope. Finer than a hair from every side. Finer than a hair. Birds. Birds. This is just a cornhusk doll. Dipped in blood in the moonlight. This is just a cornhusk doll. This morning in my room. A little swallow was trapped. It flew around desperately. Until it fell exhausted on my bed. I picked it up. So as not to frighten it. I opened the window. Then I opened my hand. Nose holes caked in black cocaine. Pow! Pow!. No one holds a match to your skin. No dupe. No chiming. A way off miles off. No needle through a glove. Famine is a tall tower. A building left in the night. Jesse are you listening?. It casts its ruins in shadows. Under Memphis moonlight. Jesse are you listening?. Six feet of foetus. Flung at sparrows in the sky. Put yourself in my shoes. A kiss, wet, muzzle. A clouded eye. No stars to flush it out. Famine is a tall tower. A building left in the night. Jesse are you listening?. It casts its ruins in shadows. Under Memphis moonlight. Jesse are you listening?. Pow! Pow!. In the dream. I am crawling around in my hands and knees. smoothing out the prairie. All the dents and the gouges. And the winds dying down. I lower my head. Press my ear to the prairie. Alive, Im the only one. Left alive. Im the only one. Left alive. Im the only one. Left alive.

As the grossness of spring lolls its bloodshot head. Curare! Curare! Curare!. Brogue cries from the street. Curare! Curare!. As the grossness of spring rose. A tumor balloon to squeak against the window. With the grossness of spring staining into the walls. The chair had been shifted ever so slightly. Say five feet or two centimeters. The prints of my fingers dusted from doorknobs. A lamp had been dimmed. Some sawdust where a ring had been. Where nice girls were turned into whores. Gardens with fountains where peacocks had strutted. Where deaf children were born. The splendor of tigers turning to gold in the desert. Pale meadows of stranded pyramids. Sonny boy. such a sonny boy. Theres a song in the air. Curare! Curare! Curare!. But the fair senorita dont seem to care. Curare! Curare! Curare!. As the grossness of spring lolls its head against the window. As the grossness of spring lolls its bloodshot head. I merely got up so slowly. Shuffled across the floor. Closed the door on the landing. Descending the stairs. Dipping into the street. The paralysed street. Brogue says Good afternoon!. I say Good afternoon!. Its a lovely afternoon. Yes, its a lovely afternoonI. Into pockets unstitching so weighted with pins. Into eyes imploding on mazes of sins. The puddle beneath the cork. Bobbing on a mild chop that rolled in. Off the river Dix and the open water beyond. Brogue says. Then me. Brogue. Sonny boy. Such a sonny boy. In her voice, theres a flaw. Sonny boy. Such a sonny boy. Eeaw and eeaw.

While plucking feathers from a swan song. Shit might pretzel Christs intestines. While plucking feathers from a swan song. Being crushed from the inside out. While plucking feathers from a swan song.

Excuse me. Dear god, excuse me. Accrue too flew and burned my teeth. With kitchen matches struck on stone. Boiling owls shriek. Arab widow flayed cadenzas. Im wading through blue, vacant veins of Sterzing. The chiseller keeps slipping away. Cholesteroled mansions crowded with sulphured air. Dip to Kyries lone whistler in the shadows. Simitar sideburn, charging on the purple purlieus. Scrape to Goitres gray carnation through the stubble. Epicanthic knobbler of ninon. Arch to Macaronic mahout in the mascon. Ah, my old scabby Sachem. A sphinters tooting our tune. If only I could pick you. Wed slosh, wed slide, wed cling. Round a kelloggs floor. His severed, yelloweyes weeping. Da da da, da da da. From the spitroast smoke curling. Da da da, da da da. Rack off from this ravished slather. Keep your vile rattus small adult hand to yourself. Take your turnshoes and wobble. Turnshoes and wobble. Jihad jive lobs leaking beanbag. Through a cutout clowns astonished mouth. Shrivelled pods climb to the sun. Beneath your skirts. Then suddenly, theres hissing on the gumbo. Im drowning in yonical tears. Grinding upheaval. Always affects the genitals. Sniff to breaths bereft Manhattans in the Duma. Unleavened breadhead. The window behind, alive with wheeze driven flakes. Bob to rotting grapes bunch brooch on chest of bruises. Nothing clears a room like removing a brain. Hail the rain. Hail the rain. Hail the rain. Ah, my sweet Sagamore wino. Face full of drunken ticks. If only I could sip you. Like flies sip at wide eyes. On a desert floor. We could move to the sticks. Say Earls Court or Embankment. While the Thames flows black as camel piss. Let the icy thermals dervish around our feet. Dare, step out on me. Ill step out on you. Dare, step out on me. Ill step out on you. Bish Bosch and what more. Aare depositions for?. Eukaryotic gobbler of gavotte. Knee to deafening tiny feet upon the branches. Altair, Vega, Drogba and Deneb. Doff to dentists stoop of moon above the haunches. Sealable nostrils. Squeezed through eye of coupling pin. Heil to oberbearing night starting to smoulder. First fiddlers mark. Right there, under the jaw. Nod to doublebladed axe. Poised over shoulder. Pain is not alone. Pain is not alone. Pain is not alone. Pain is not alone. Pain is not alone. Pain is not alone. Pain is not alone. Pain is not alone. Neath a protein moon. In a protein sky. Running protein fields. With my protein eye. Theres a protein song. Howling through the meat. Driving protein bods. From my protein street. Pain is not alone. Pain is not alone. Pain is not alone. Pain is not alone. From the south, the Klan sends roses. Lymphlacquered nails hover in waifed autumn sun. For dragging down the back of summer. From the east come killer poses. Khrushchevs shoe beats a black tattoo. In the middle of the day. From the north flow floats with quivering virgins. Fresh from frozen catacombs. Did ya spot the diecut crosses?. Did ya?. Did ya?. Pain is not alone. Pain is not alone. Pain is not alone. Pain is not alone. Neath a protein moon. In a protein sky. Running protein fields. With my protein eye. Heres to a lousy life. Heres to a lousy life. Heres to a lousy life. Heres to a lousy life. This is my job. I dont come around and put out your red light. When you work. Whats the matter?. Didnt you get enough attention at home?. If shit were music. La da da, la da da. Youd be a brass band. Know what?. You should get an agent, oh yeah, yeah. Why sit in the dark handling yourself?. For Lavinia. Who goes like gynozoon. For the citizen. Whose joke lays in their hand. To play fugues. On Joves Spam castanets. Cattle are slaughtered. Entrails examined. Spread out across the moon. The Tisza is rising. Topless bars overflowing. Pulsing through the flumes. Dropkicked coloraturas. Fouling my ears. Bypassing an anorexic sky and. Scar jumping grafters. Chorioncrying. How can you stoop so high?. For Papiria. Who plops the Pantheon. For grosse Gauls. Who wont leave our sheep alone. Norsemen do not eat the big pink mint. Flush hard. Its a long way to Athens. Gone from your wooden palace. The wild mice pelt clothes slipped from my toes. Where termites scribble the walls. Twisted forth and gone, Little father. The snip off your nineninetynine. Ffrom where you groomed yourself too small. No more dragging this wormy anus. Round on shag piles from Persia to Thrace. Ive severed my reeking gonads. Fed them to your shrunken face. Janus head. Its said will give good door. For a Roman. Whos proof that Greeks fucked bears. Heard this one?. Thisll kill ya. About the ropes of hair. Care of Venus the Bald. Tugging Mercs across the plain. Those measuring roadrashed bellies. A perte de vue to me night and day. The one about the saint. Sstranded high upon his pillar. Thirty summers, thirty winters. His constant visitor, his mother. But hed stare into the distance. Ignored her calls from down below. Did you ever throw your own mothers food back at her?. Did you ever tell her, Take this junk away.?. What kind of unnatural son would do that to his own mother?. The tasteless one about the bantam. Who couldnt climb a rung. Your Helipolis is scrapheap. Gone, the brown slug of your tongue. For eunuch Ron. Who sleeps at night across the emperors bedroom door. GrostulatingGorbi. Requires fresh packing. Over, its over. Syrinx screaming all around. Bar, bar, bar. Bar, bar, bar, bar, bar. AquilAetos, aquilaetos. Screaming all around. Filling up my life. Screaming all around. Bar, bar, bar. Bar, bar, bar, bar, bar. Over, its over. Your Nibelung cant be found. Their shadowless shadows wiping me. Wiping me clean away. Bar, bar, bar. Bar, bar, bar, bar, bar. Wheres the scent of pine torches. The lumbering caravans. The felt covered wagons, moving like galleons?. The wedgie, the melvy to threaten the air?. Only fledge muffled long hollow bonedrums abeating. The dark day behind us, the dark day ahead. The wind drone across skull goblets. Then BaselcumStrasbourgcumFrankfurtcumSpeyercum. I hear the only place youre ever invited is outside. If brains were rain. Youd surely be a desert. Look, dont go to a mind reader. Go to a palmist. I know youve got a palm. Does your face hurt?. Cause its killing me. Cut to lost Lumbago City. I am perched against the sky. A banner shoal of sparrows. Sways in the twilight. Down there, as ish kabibbles. Schlepp the shade forever. Earths hoary fontenelle. Weeps softly for a thumb thrust. A chorus of threadbare blackstockinged legs. Is fanning out into a frazzled black rose. No phalanxes fleeing like zippers of blood. Red plumes nodding between the horses ears. Hey buddy, give it up. Hey pal, come down, join the living. Wanted A lisping, hobbling, noseless runt. Phone IXIXIXIXIXIXI. Remember. Someday youll go far if you catch the right train.. How about. Youre so fat. When you wear a yellow raincoat, people scream, Taxi!.. Then theres. Youre so boring, you cant even evertain doubt.. Ill grease this pole behind me. Grease this pole behind me. Grease this pole. Grease this pole. Theres an unfinished rumour doing the rounds. It seems the storks are seen returning to the rooftops. Carrying back their children. Clacking like dried palms. Loud enough to be heard from Reims to Orleans. River banks are cleared, bridges retaken. Oblivion, driven from the city street by street. So why have screams of laughter. The pissing stench of maresmilk beer. Come to bait your toad down from his toadstool?. And if Im melancholic. And if I shed a tear. Dont forget to blink. Lest your eyeballs dry up. Fall out of their sockets. And dangle on your cheeks like Caesars shrivelled coglione. Its when I hear a sawedoff coffin. Rolls beneath the Tisza. Hey bar. Ah, my noblest music. Hey bar, bar, bar, bar. Ill grease this pole behind me. Grease this pole behind me. Grease this pole. Grease this pole. Over, its over. But wheres the electrons. Squeezing all around?. Burning up my life. Squeezing all around. Over, its over. Only freezing all around. I greased that pole behind me. Greased that pole behind me. Your Nibelung cant be found. Ive looked high and low for you. I guess I didnt look low enough. Dont move. I want to forget you just the way you are. I really hope your face clears up. You know, I think youve got nothing there. Infrared, infrared. I could drop into the darkness. Its so cold, infrared. What if I freeze and drop into the darkness?. Maman Neigho was frightened by Hawaiians. When all the veins ran out. When too much bone structure went missing. She thumbed the galleon Cacafuego. Forsook the eyebrows climbing into greasy black hairlines. Narcrotic leis yanked down around the melianomed ankles. Their putrid petals dropping, erasing the white shoes. Like a face being eaten by a jungle. Slabs of steam tables whiffing of onions and roses. Haunted Jacuzzis churning. All night the native bods squealing Bflat. Like choirs of pigs seeking revenge for stolen insulin. Blip, boost, bust, brother. Thats how we copped a final. Reached this city without sound. Everywhere you turn. Bunkers of rubber hoses pronging up off the citys floor. Chirp, chime, clambaked, cups. Dont step on that rotting tartare. Just might bust your conk. Might lay your racket. Early black ickaroo. Its dense, tense. Unseen through, pound for pound. All the people,on the corners. Pushing each other around. Humping like buggers, touching like muggers. Pushing each other around. Adepocere in a zoot. Sloshing, karat, ballooning down the street. Thousand kilos simpy, forty stone send. Tips his skypiece, come to weigh me up. But Im toned. Gut bucket. Ground grippers ready to trilly. Layin down iron, togged to the bricks. Shh. Lets add a little shade. Try something apart from the hogshair. While Pope Julius affects his red slippers. Let Michelangelo tiptoe around in his dogskin boots. Shh. The powder on a chalky bosom. Rises and hangs in the air. Clouds crawling through protracted blue. Like souls of insects. From threshing haze. The scent of spider lilies. Sam Ps bagged decapitation. Rotates to the ocean floor. Its nostrils are twitching and sniffing. Gabriels gravy. Got your glasses on, gate. Theres some mezz glimmers, a gammon V. Twisters in the slammer. Frisking their whiskers. Till peola dim on the chime of black. Its dense, tense. Unseen through, pound for pound. Scratch and Jesus on the corner. Pushing each other around. Shoving like sluggers, touching like muggers. Pushing each other around. Snapping their caps, slidin their jibs. Lampin the brees, drapin the trees. Oops, pardon the elbow. Lets just shift you over here. Sorry, Im so clumsy. Take that accidently in the bollocks for a start. Seven brights jumped in port. Reached this city without sound. Kopasetic, on the corners. Pushing each other around. Everybody on the corners. Pushing each other around. Joe below, hincty dicty. Slipped the pounders, fews and two. Knock me, boot me. Down in the land of darkness. Sweet Leilani, heavenly flower. November in July. Eyes glistening in darkness. Like freshly crushed flies. Fourteen bones held together. By avian phlegm. When the whistling has ended. I wont stale again. Slurry soul, unbearable clink. Fraying through tartared chink. Took the Dorgi, left the dent. Frozen fast in the sagging night. of silence, of shame. When the sneezings subsided. I wont stare again. Inkadinkadink. Hej do, hej do. Adinkadinkadinkadoo. Hej do, hej do. Jutland is crooning narcrotic Lorilies. Ingen, ingenting, ingen, ingenting. Awaiting command. Its huge snout wedged between my thighs. Ingen, ingenting, ingen, ingenting. Inkadinkadink. Hej do, hej do. Adinkadinkadinkadoo. Hej do, hej do. Jutland is hvining while stars fall in thuds. Ingen, ingenting, ingen, ingenting. Flattening the cheek, like soft muffled scuds. Ingen, ingenting, ingen, ingenting. Tongues lick the lead Lego. They wont be denied. If youre listening to this. You must have survived. My only pige passed your only dreng. In Jutlands sheer city. Farvel, farvel. November in July. Apropolis lip to where acidfast fly. Crepey and shiny guanine restrain. While out lifting scalp. I will not glare again. Took the shilling, ditched the score. Frozen fast in the lowering night. In the lowering lefttesticle night. Heya, heya, heya, heya. Heya, heya, heya, heya. Room full of mice. Room full of mice. Room full of mice. Room full of mice. Heya, heya, heya, heya. Heya, heya, heya, heya. Room full of mice. Room full of mice. Room full of mice. Room full of mice. Blowing up bullfrogs with a straw. Blowing up bullfrogs with a straw.
